  abstract={Signatures play a crucial role in human life as part of their identity. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the smart home system using the Internet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, signature recognition and verification can play essential roles in finance, banking, home system, insurance, and others. This paper’s main objective is to design and implement a signature recognition system on a single board computer, i.e., Raspberry Pi 3 equipped with an LCD touchscreen. First, the acquired signature image was cropped and resized. Next, a binary image was extracted as features to train the artificial neural network (ANN). The trained ANN was used to classify the input signature to determine whether the signature is genuine or forged. Results showed that the recognition rate of 99.77% was achieved using a confidence level threshold of 85% during testing.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things(IoT) has made it possible to set up a smart home security through which you can decide who can enter your home using your smartphone and web application. It's also made it simple and relatively affordable to monitor your home anytime and anywhere. the key issue in a traditional home security system is, it is easily breakable and quite outdated. This in turns, results in the robbery and also needs installation of the costly security system. To tackle this problem, we propose a smart home security system, which is IoT as well as face recognition enabled. In our system, the web camera is used which is connected to the raspberry pi accompanied by sensors such as Passive Infrared(Pir) and Ultrasonic sensor. On motion detection camera captures an image of the person in front of the door then real-time face recognition is done using local binary pattern (LBP). If person's image matches with one of the home members then the door will unlock, else doorbell will ring. if an intruder tries to break door then an alarm will be raised at the same time SMS and Email containing image of the intruder will be sent to the homeowner. Face recognition works well in multi-face recognition and stranger identification, which meet the requirement of home security. This system is battery powered in case of power failure. Furthermore, the house owner can keep track of activity happening in the house using android and web application connected to the raspberry pi using the internet. Using Android application or web application owner can also add new person's faces into the databases eg., guests.},

  abstract={Home security remains an essential consideration in this decade, as property crime continues to be a significant concern in Malaysia. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, where preventing virus transmission is of utmost importance, integrating home security with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has become increasingly relevant. This study aims to develop a smart edge device for enhancing the security of houses in residential areas. A real-time facial recognition security system is constructed using You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 7, in conjunction with the Facenet models. These models have been trained, evaluated, and integrated with a Raspberry Pi to establish communication with the user through Node-RED and the Telegram User Interface (UI), utilizing the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The performance of the developed facial recognition security system is compared with other state-of-the-art systems in terms of facial recognition accuracy and inference speed on edge devices. The proposed algorithm achieves a remarkable 94.14% accuracy at a speed of 0.8 FPS.},

  abstract={Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous technology that connects a large number of devices together for people to be more convenient from using of new technologies. However, having these devices connected to the Internet may expose them to various risks malicious and suspicious attacks. In addition, after the device installation, these devices normally do not receive full security measurement, resulting in becoming the attacking and intruding targets. This research studies and focuses on the security threats in smart home networks by using Raspberry Pi which is low cost and portable. Our system, which is called PITI, performs hybrid detection by combining Snort IDS and behavior-based profile analysis together in order to efficiently detect malicious and suspicious traffic. The current version of PITI can alert anomaly traffic by showing a message on the screen and also alert by sounds. For the future work, PITI device should be developed into Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which can drop the suspicious packets and detect more type of attacks.},

  abstract={With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of devices are being connected to each other every day. Each connectivity opens the door to new possibilities to make a person's life easier and convenient. A smart home is one such area impacted by IoT which greatly improves a person's life by helping them create a secure environment for his family and carry out his day-to-day activities with ease. Focusing primarily in the context of Nepal where available smart systems are either expensive or lack basic features, this paper essentially deals with the design and implementation of a cost-efficient smart home system focusing on remote surveillance, monitoring different aspects (movement detections, surveillance and temperature and humidity) of a home with notification alerts. Furthermore, the system also aims to reduce electricity usage and minimize energy consumption by helping a person automate their everyday tasks such as turning on/off lights, thermostats, etc. by detecting their presence. Raspberry Pi is the heart of the home system managing all of these services. In addition, Amazon Cloud Services, Simple Email Service (SES) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) are used for notifying users/home-owners. The product could further be regarded as a prototype and additional features could be added on top of it to create one's own version of “smart home”.},

  abstract={Face recognition system is broadly used for human identification because of its capacity to measure the facial points and recognize the identity in an unobtrusive way. The application of face recognition systems can be applied to surveillance at home, workplaces, and campuses, accordingly. The problem with existing face recognition systems is that they either rely on the facial key points and landmarks or the face embeddings from FaceNet for the recognition process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical network (HN) framework which uses pre-trained architecture for recognizing faces followed by the validation from face embeddings using FaceNet. We also designed a real-time face recognition security door lock system connected with raspberry pi as an implication of the proposed method. The evaluation of the proposed work has been conducted on the dataset collected from 12 students from Faculty of Engineering and Technology, University of Sindh. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results over existing works. We also carried out a comparison on random faces acquired from the Internet to perform face recognition and results shows that the proposed HN framework is resilient to the randomly acquired faces.},

  abstract={Before inception of Internet of Things (IoT), personal computers and laptop were used to handle daily tasks of individuals like mail surfing, access to bank portal, observing current temperature, among others. Nowadays, IoT-enabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in IoT. Smart homes have been widely accepted by individuals and organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like: delay, non-web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence, considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the delay during process of e-mail alert. This paper also confirms the advantage of Raspberry Pi flexibility and broad probability of its usage. Preliminary analyses have shown encouraging results.},

  abstract={Enhancing the home security by remote control means is a cutting-edge research area in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT's). The necessity of security is increasing these days, ranging from thefts, burglary, accidents, LPG gas leakage and fire detection etc, which all are important aspects of a Home Security System. In this paper, a prototype Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home (SSH) model is developed. Generally a home security system uses signals in terms of alarm of intruder detection. However, the proposed Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home uses a mobile communication (GSM) based Home Security System, which helps to provide a better security to have systems that can be globally connected. In the proposed system a text message is sent, whenever an event from any sensor is detected, so that immediate actions could be taken by the home owner. The proposed SSH sends SMS using GSM-Module and mail through Raspberry Pi micro-controller. The prototype SSH based smart system also uses an Arduino micro-controller board for commands processing and control. The system uses GSM technology, which provides global access to the Smart Home Security System. The prototype SSH, developed at a low cost, can be used for converting existing homes into smart homes at relatively affordable cost and with convenience. The performance testing results of the prototype SSH are encouraging.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is moving us towards smart homes for more security and energy efficiency. This paper presents design and implementation of a ubiquitous home controlling and monitoring system that uses an inexpensive Raspberry PI as the home automation hub to connect with various household devices. Via smartphones or tablets, home owners can remotely and continuously monitor their home environment including temperature, humidity, security, and energy consumption and adjust it to a desired level, thereby gaining more security and energy saving. As an initial step, we evaluated and compared three IoT application layer protocols REST, CoAP and MQTT and our findings suggest MQTT outperforms the other two in the smart home we aim to build. Moreover, using a Raspberry PI as the home automation hub can overcome the interoperability challenges facing commercial home automation components. Our experience shows that the line of code (LOC) for adding a new device to the home automation hub is about 60 lines of Java code. We hope this work can benefit research in the smart home. The source code for this work is online available for access.},

  abstract={The present generation devices are built with smart capabilities. The intelligence is embedded in them to act wise in deployed environment. Mirrors are basically used in home for the purpose of grooming up or getting ready for the day. The same mirrors can be made to behave Smart to provide Security and Vigilance in deployed environment. Smart mirror is a system that not only works as a normal mirror but also provides Security against intrusion inside the home. The proposed system is designed using Raspberry Pi, Camera, Raspberry Pi compatible touch screen and microphone as hardware components and Python for programming. The proposed system can accept 3 modes of input commands namely Voice, Touch and Mobile commands. The Smart mirror can be used as a security system against the Intrusion in home. The Yolo Technique with OpenCV for object detection is used for detection of Intrusion of Human. The Yolo (You Only Look Once) is a Machine Learning concept for the detection of objects. The Yolo is an optimized technique as it looks image only once as compared to other image processing techniques, hence work faster. The Video is converted to frames and the frames are given as input to the Raspberry Pi. The Python programming is used along-with the Yolo technique with OpenCV to detect objects. As soon as the intrusion is confirmed, the administrator of the Smart Mirror will be sent an alert E-mail along-with the photo of an intruder and the details are stored in the storage device. The voice and Touch screen commands can be used whenever an administrator/owner is in front of the mirror. The mobile based controls can be used when the administrator/owner of the mirror is away from the mirror. The basic theme of the proposed model is that, to make use of household devices for providing security.},

  abstract={Smart Home System involves controlling home appliances using the Internet of Things (IoT) allowing us to have a user-friendly home automation system. It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others. The main purpose of our paper is to build a perfect smart home-helper for the users to operate the home appliances easily through voice commands.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that allows connection between devices using the internet to collect and exchange data with each other. Privacy and security have become the most pressing issues in the IoT network, especially in the smart home. Nevertheless, there are still many smart home devices that have not implemented security and privacy policies. This study proposes a remote sensor control system built on ESP32 to implement a smart home through the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) protocol by applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key. It addresses security issues in the smart home by encrypting messages sent from users to sensors. Besides ESP32, the system implementation also uses Raspberry Pi and smartphone with Android applications. The network was analyzed using Wireshark, and it showed that the message sent was encrypted. This implementation could prevent brute force attacks, with the result that it could guarantee the confidentiality of a message. Meanwhile, from several experiments conducted in this study, the difference in the average time of sending encrypted and unencrypted messages was not too significant, i.e., 20 ms.},

  abstract={The IoT enabled with smart security system presents security to the home and also providing a facility to the user where one can continuously monitor the surrounding parameters inside the house (like temperature, smoke and light intensity) and can control them by collection and exchange of data between the things for example switching on/off devices (like fan and light based on these parameters). In recent days when ever house is locked the break-ins number has been increased enormously. So in order to provide security to the home this presented paper is helpful. When the intruders enters into the house, image of the intruder is captured by the system, even if intruder escapes Police need to caught the intruder to recover the stolen things which needs the picture of the intruder to the police. The planned system captures the picture of the intruder and sends it to the authorized mail through internet over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). So security to the home is provided more effectively in the smart way of communicating the things. Home appliances are smartly automated to reduce the human effort for intelligent decisions with the help of Internet Of Things (IoT). This compact and lightweight product is designed to provide security and to control home appliances in the house by the owner through IoT servers. Microcontroller used here is Raspberry Pi3 for all processing and controlling operations. Various sensors such as LM35 a temperature sensor, Light Dependent Resistor, PIR sensor with a magnetic door switch, smoke sensor are interfaced to pi General Purpose Input Output port pins through Analog to Digital Converter module along with a camera and LAN connection is interfaced to the pi board.},

  abstract={Home automation means controlling of home functions and features automatically and sometimes remotely using one or more computers. An automated home is also called as a smart home. Speech based home automation uses human voice commands to operate the electrical appliances in the home. It is very useful for human beings especially for elderly and physically handicapped people. In this paper, we present the implementation details of two schemes for speech based home automation and control. The first scheme uses the Bluetooth technology for controlling of electrical appliances when we are at home. It uses a HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino Bluetooth controller mobile application for switching on or off the appliances. The second scheme uses GSM/GPRS technology for controlling the electrical appliances. The developed system also alerts the user about any intrusion into the house when we are away from the home. This system is implemented on ARM11 Raspberry Pi microcontroller board. Python integrated development environment (IDE) is used for developing the necessary software. Relays and bulbs are used as load to demonstrate the working of the prototype system. Home automation system gives accessibility, comfort, energy efficiency, security by providing control and monitoring of appliances, security surveillance.},

  abstract={The rapid proliferation of embedded devices has led to the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) with applications in numerous domains such as home automation, healthcare, education and agriculture. However, many of the connected devices particularly in smart homes are the target of attacks that try to exploit security vulnerabilities such as hard-coded passwords and insecure data transfer. Recent studies show that there is a considerable surge in the number of phishing attacks targeting smart homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many of the existing user authentication protocols in the literature incur additional computational overhead and need to be made more resilient to smart home targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight and privacy-preserving remote user authentication protocol for securing smart home applications. Our approach is based on Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) to make our protocol resilient to smart home attacks such as smartphone capture attacks and phishing attacks. In addition, the lightweight nature of our solution is suitable for deployment on heterogeneous and resource constrained IoT devices. Besides, we leverage geometric secret sharing for establishing mutual authentication among the participating entities. We validate the security of the proposed protocol using the AVISPA formal verification tool and prototype it on a Raspberry Pi to analyze the power consumption. Finally, a comparison with existing schemes reveals that our scheme incurs a 20% reduction in communication overhead on smart devices. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is usable as it absolves users from memorizing passwords and carrying smart cards.},

  abstract={A smart door system which can be controlled by the android application installed on smart phone is proposed in this paper. Earlier, smart locks were used which enhanced the security features of the house. The proposed model can eliminate the concept of lock system as here the security is provided to the door itself. This would result in a safe and secure door with no locks! Controlling the movement of the door is enabled by Raspberry pi and its related embedded software. Also merging IOT with android is has many advantages in terms of security. The motion sensors are used to detect any movement in front of the door. If any person comes in front of the door, a motion is triggered; the image is captured and notified to the owner. Thus in overall proposed system, two technologies are concentrated on, one is motion sensing in the front of the door in real time even if there is no one at home and the second is to control the movement of the door by the smart phone. Thus by connecting a mobile phone to a door, the owner get notified whenever any visitor visits his home and looking up to the images, the owner of the home can send the open door signal for only the trusted visitors.},

  abstract={Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a smart home has become inevitable due to the recent surge in the use of smart devices by the visually impaired. The visually impaired users rely heavily on these IoT devices and assistive technologies for guidance, medical usage, mobility help, voice recognition, news feeds and emergency communications. However, cyber attackers are deploying Evil Twin and Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, among others, to penetrate the network, establish rogue Wi-Fi access points and trick victims into connecting to it, leading to interceptions, manipulation, exploitation, compromising the smart devices and taking command and control. The paper aims to explore the Evil Twin attack on smart devices and provide mitigating techniques to improve privacy and trust. The novelty contribution of the paper is three-fold: First, we identify the various IoT device vulnerabilities and attacks. We consider the state-of-the-art IoT cyberattacks on Smart TVs, Smart Door Lock, and cameras. Secondly, we created a virtual environment using Kali Linux (Raspberry Pi) and NetGear r7000 as the home router for our testbed. We deployed an Evil Twin attack to penetrate the network to identify the vulnerable spots on the IoT devices. We consider the Kill Chain attack approach for the attack pattern. Finally, we recommend a security mechanism in a table to improve security, privacy and trust. Our results show how vulnerabilities in smart home appliances are susceptible to attacks. We have recommended mitigation techniques to enhance the security for visually impaired users.},

ARGUS provides an overall network security coverage for both incoming and outgoing traffic, a firewall and an adaptive bandwidth management system and a sophisticated CCTV surveillance capability. ARGUS is such a system that is implemented into an existing router incorporating cloud and Machine Learning (ML) technology to ensure seamless connectivity across multiple devices, including IoT devices at a low migration cost for the customer. The aggregation of the above features makes ARGUS an ideal solution for existing Smart Home System service providers and users where hardware and infrastructure is also allocated. ARGUS was tested on a small-scale smart home environment with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B controller. Its intrusion detection system identified an intrusion with 96% accuracy while the physical surveillance system predicts the user with 81% accuracy.},

  abstract={Automated secure entry is a basic need in today's Home Automation System. To accomplish this need, we are proposing secure home entry system using Internet of Things. This proposal is an attempt to construct a smart, innovative and secure entry by using the raspberry pi controller, camera and various other associated sensors. To enhance the home security system, the best possible way is to use facial recognition and has been implemented in our proposal. In existing system, notification is through E-mail or Twitter account. Due to popularity and flexibility of using current social network for all type of generation, we are proposing home security system using Telegram notification. The advantage of using Telegram App for this project is to send notification to the user as it provides an instant secure communication between the user and the home automation system.},

  abstract={Over the course of last decade, home security and automation systems have been gaining extreme popularity because of the enhancement in the field of science and the concomitant risks of breaking in the system. This paper envisions a smart home based on the two independent and emerging technologies viz face recognition, for the security purposes, and speech recognition, for the automation purposes. Moreover, the latest work done is discussed briefly and why an offline system was an urgent need to fill the gap in the recent technology protocols introduced in the related field. Security system ensures the working of the smart home by taking the image on the ringing of the bell and comparing it with the stored database of owners in a robust and reliable manner through Raspberry Pi microcontroller and OpenCV. Voice control over the whole house makes this system effective and efficient which could turn out to be a great charity to handicapped, elder and paralyzed people in the remote areas with no access to internet by a single voice command in the mic connected to Arduino V3 module.},

  abstract={Securing IoT networks has been one of recent most active research topics. However, unlike traditional network security, where the emphasis is given on the core network, IoT networks are mostly investigated from the data stand-point. Lightweight data transmission protocols, such as Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), are often deployed for data-sharing and device authentication due to limited onboard resources. This paper presents the MQTT protocol's security vulnerabilities by incorporating Elliptic Curve Cryptography-based (ECC-based) security to improve confidentiality issues. We used commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) devices such as Raspberry Pi to build a simplified network topology that connects IoT devices in our smart home laboratory. The results illustrate an ECC-based security application in confidentiality increase of 70.65% from 29.35% in time parameter during publish/subscribe communication protocol for the smart home.},

  abstract={The market for Domotics, most commonly known as Home Automation, has exponentially grown in the past few years. In brief, Domotics allows users to monitor and control various devices/appliances within a smart home. From entertainment to security, several devices have become more accessible. However, the underlying network infrastructure in this environment has remained the same despite the recent revolution brought about by Software-Defined Networking (SDN).For the past decade, SDN has shown great potential for providing more network flexibility and programmability in both the control and data plane. However, most of the use cases are thought for enterprise and Data-Center Networks, while its application closer to the end-users (i.e., Home environments) is still under-exploited. Therefore, this research introduces the Network Operations for Domotics (NeO-Domotics) notion, which uses Next-Generation SDN components (e.g., P4, NG-SDN interfaces) in the context of Home Automation. This paper describes the overall design and showcases preliminary use cases using a Raspberry Pi.},

  abstract={In the digital era of mobile technology, smart light control via voice and motion on the internet of things through the use of Raspberry Pi may assist them in managing their daily lives more conveniently, efficiently, and securely. The security of their lives and possessions is critical. The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a smart light control and intruder detection system using Raspberry Pi based on the internet of things. The proposed prototype supports Wi-Fi and 4G mobile connections in a home or outdoor environment. The methodology used in this study is for manual control of on-off lights and detection of an intruder with a range of response times, including low, medium, and high response delays (1, 2.5, and 5 seconds). The testing results compare the Average Response Time and the Average Effectiveness Response Time for mobile connections over 4G and Wi-Fi. The results support the on-off lights, with response accuracy rates of 78 percent, 84 percent, and 100 percent for Thai and English voice commands on Google Assistance and the Blynk mobile application, respectively. As a result, the research examines the response time for various environments with varying levels of mobile communication. The proposed system has designed and evaluated a prototype of smart light control and intruder detection using the Internet of Things. This prototype can be used in daily life to increase convenience, reduce time spent on tasks, reduce costs, and increase security.},

The most pressing bottleneck of running algorithms in IoT devices is the availability of low computation resources. The state-of-the-art algorithms which work significantly well in high-end computing unit more often fail to operate in IoT devices like Raspberry pi. This work targets design of a face authenticated door-lock security system in Raspberry pi and, therefore, evaluates the performance of conventional face detection and recognition models. The local binary pattern histogram (LBPH), eigenface and fisherface algorithms are considered for evaluation. The evaluation analyzes the accuracy of a model in detecting human faces, its computation time and vulnerability to photo hacking while implemented in Raspberry pi platform. It covers a large number of stored faces and the cases of variation in angle and illumination in the face image. The python and c++ bindings to the opencv framework are considered to create a fully functional face recognition system hardware.},

  abstract={The advancement of automation technologies made lives simpler and easier in all aspects. In today’s world, automated systems [1] are replacing manual systems progressively. In this paper, an overview of current and emerging home automation systems is discussed. Then, the developed system is presented that is a one-stop-shop for all the use cases with the novelty of transforming traditional homes into smart homes through merging Artificial Intelligence (AI) [2] and Internet of Things (IoT) [3] thus providing the freedom to connect, integrate, monitor, and control houses remotely, securely, and at a cheaper cost. The use of AI allows monitoring and analyzing data through dashboards. Hence, sending realtime notifications to the user to ensure home management and security remotely. Also, the novelty in introducing IoT in this system is through incorporating different modalities and functions in one system controlled remotely for example the automation and monitoring system [4], the wireless [5] irrigation system, and the security system. All the components are controlled and monitored using a central web and mobile application. On the hardware components side, the system consists of the Raspberry Pi, the RFID Card Reader, the 8-channel relay module, and some sensors.

  abstract={In recent years considerable progress has been made in the area of face recognition. Through the work of computer science engineers, computers can now outperform humans in many face recognition tasks, particularly those in which large databases of faces must be searched. A system with the ability to detect and recognize faces has many potential applications including crowd and airport surveillance, private security and improved human-computer interaction. An automatic face recognition system is perfectly suited to fix security issues and offer flexibility to smart house control. This project aims to replace costly image processing boards using Raspberry pi board with ARMv7 Cortex-A7 as the core within Opencv library. This project is mainly based on image processing by porting the Opencv library to the Raspberry Pi board. Algorithm for face recognition, based on principal component analysis (PCA), is programmed and implemented on the platform. The system is based on the criteria of low power consumption, resources optimization, and improved operation speed. This paper reviews the related work in the field of home automation systems and presents the system design, software algorithm, implementation and results.},

Our paper primarily concentrates on children safety and ensures security in every aspect. The proposed system employs Raspberry Pi for processing the data which is measured by the sensor and communicate to the user through the internet. As Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest version and has much more functions, it is used and provided with Type $\mathbf{C}$ supply. The designed system helps to save the small children from the harmful or tragic situation in the absence of parents. The solenoid lock works according to the command given by the user through the mobile application. Hence as the user commands according to the information that he observe on his mobile application. So, by implementing this project commercially, it saves the life of small children.},

  abstract={Home or Office Automation may be described as a system to provide ease of operation of connected devices or appliances. Most commercial environments, during active hours, consume large amounts of energy resources; this could be optimized to the minimum by smartly monitoring and managing the resources. IoT (Internet of Things) enables this to be a possible solution at reasonable cost factors. However, it is important to note that in commercial environments, security is a key factor; corporations cannot depend on opening up their networks to the outside world in order to avail the services offered by currently available smart-devices. Localizing and privatizing the entire automation and control system would be desirable for such domains. The work presented in this paper proposes a solution for such applications which is crucial for the development of Smart Cities as a whole along with Smart Homes. One of the simplest tasks is to switch a light source, HVAC systems or any other electrical equipment on or off, by being physically present in the premises, remotely or automatically based on time or a sensor's reading. Furthermore, the intensity of the light source, the temperature of the HVAC systems and such parameters could also be varied. Development of technology in the field has enabled the production of cheap and small-sized computers like Raspberry Pi which are also known as Single Board Computers (SBC). The prototype designed is equipped with a secure local MQTT link for communication between the control and automation system and the Edge Devices. Additionally, it is equipped with a speech recognition system to give the users a much more intuitive and natural mean to communicate with and control the connected devices.},

An emulated smart home scenario with five virtual sensor devices hosted by a Raspberry Pi edge device has been used as a case study to investigate the properties of the system. We have studied the results coming from applying the newly developed configuration management patterns to set or modify some environment variables remotely and inside the edge node. Furthermore, various operational cases have been studied to experimentally verify the difference when enabling edge analytics and when sending raw readings to the cloud. Indeed, the case of using symmetric encryption to increase the security aspects of the application has been studied and experimentally verified.},

Due to the ever-increasing responsibilities and daily tasks, people spend most of the time away from their homes. In such situations, identifying a visitor and getting remote access to their home is indispensable. A smart door lock which can be completely monitored and controlled from a remote location using an android application on a smartphone is proposed in this paper. When a visitor presses a calling bell/push button at the door, a Raspberry Pi with HD camera gets powered up and notifies the owner with a message and streams visitors' live identity on owner's mobile over the Internet. The owner, based on his willingness, can easily open/close the door remotely by entering a password that was preset. In addition, he can also convey an audio message to the visitor by entering the corresponding text in his smartphone app. The proof of concept provided in this paper emphasizes the real-time remote accessibility in the owner's hand (smartphone) on an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) over a cloud server.},

  abstract={In this paper, a secure transmission method based on the wireless vision sensor network (WVSN) using the surveillance system was proposed. The computation task has been divided between the sensor node and the central server. A low complexity algorithm was calculated on the sensor node, and the central server computed the high operation algorithm. We also proposed the foreground segmentation algorithm to get the foreground mask which can protect the user security. Based on this technique, we have implemented it in some home-care applications. The foreground segmentation achieved a high recognition rate. Our proposed was able to achieve real-time processing information on raspberry pi 3. This system can be extended to other smart home applications in the future.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications utilize low-powered battery operated devices and reliable event notifications depend on low-power messages from the sensors node to the server and vice versa over bandwidth constrained unreliable channels. Publish/subscribe communications protocols play an important part in such low-powered device communications with MQTT protocol being most prevalent for such deployments. These protocols have enabled IoT applications such as smart home, fleet management, oil pipelines and space exploration that heavily depend on reliable communications. This paper investigates utilization of MQTT protocol for a smart home security system. A Raspberry Pi implementation detects an intrusion event using a passive infrared sensor triggering an image capture which is then communicated to the subscribed client for countermeasures. Results for power consumption and data transfer are provided that help understand the behaviour with different service qualities.},

  abstract={Due to the sheer number and heterogeneity of IoT devices, it is not possible to secure the IoT ecosystem using traditional endpoint and network security solutions. To address the requirements of securing IoT devices in edge home networks, this paper proposed a strategy capable of securing the network against most malicious activity in real-time. Firstly, we use an edge smart gateway, which is deployed on a Raspberry-Pi, runs an SDN controller and Open vSwtich (OVS) to perform traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. Then, with limited resources available on edge gateway, we use a lightweight machine-learning algorithm to classify device to device traffic and identify if there is a network intrusion. The classification model extracts features of network traffic, trained by classic supervised learning method-Decision Tree J48, then distinguish between benign and malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. Simulation results show that the model has high accuracy of intrusion and can effectively ensure security of home IoT interactions.},

This paper proposes an idea of Health Monitoring System which monitors the physiological parameters of the patient which includes Temperature, heartbeat, ECG, with the use of these sensors which can be connected to Raspberry Pi Board that transmits the data to a local server. In case of any odd behavior or any critical signs and symptoms are recognized, the caretaker in addition to medical doctors are notified by right way through the message or E-mail. To design an efficient Remote Monitoring System, Security is of paramount importance. subsequently to provide security to the patient's data Shamir's Secret key Sharing Algorithm is used in which data and keys will get split, saved at different location and to retrieve them threshold cryptography is used.

  abstract={Security of the smart home environment network could be a significant problem for People with Disabilities specially during pandemic time. There are many IoT devices brought into their houses. Number of ads and distractions with them is just growing up. IoT device created to help PwD to feel more comfortable and easier to interact with the outer world (as an example visually impaired users). What if we make them trigger some tasks just with a simple voice command? This will allow PwD to become more independent to control the whole network. With the help of Alexa Echo device, Raspberry Pi, OpenDNS, and some networking configuration we could implement a comprehensive network control solution. Previous research gave us the idea that a small device like Raspberry Pi could be a good and cheap solution for that purpose. With the Pi4 release it got even more obvious to try using this device as main DNS server for the whole network. It will run in the background of the home environment controlling the whole traffic that goes through the router. Every device connected to the network however will be having the benefits of non-distracting and quicker internet. In addition, the feature of controlling the network with the simple voice command through Alexa device will be a handy additional functionality to PwD and whole network. In the future project this whole setup could be adjusted to prevent any malicious attack with the help of AI assistance and Machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract={Smart home technology is gaining popularity among end-users, as it allows them to remotely control a variety of devices in their homes. Such systems have obvious benefits in terms of automation, but at the same time pose significant threats to home owners if the underlying communications are not secure. To this end, we introduce a novel security protocol that simplifies the pairwise authentication and key exchange among smart home devices. The protocol leverages identity-based cryptography (IBC), thus relaxing the requirement for storing and managing public key certificates. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks associated with centralized key generation in IBC, we opt to generate the private keys in a distributed manner, involving all smart devices. We implemented our protocol on Raspberry Pi 3 devices and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of both computational and communication cost.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is now a critical component of home automation and security, particularly for door lock systems. Face recognition powered by IoT is becoming more popular because it is dependable and simple to use. To prevent algorithmic errors and produce enhanced accuracy than existing systems, our system employs a facial recognition door lock with the integration of three algorithms on a single camera. The system detects unauthorized people near the entrance and notifies the user via a mobile app. For hardware communication, we used a camera module, a Raspberry PI, passive infrared motion sensors, and wireless internet access. The Python and OpenCV libraries are used in the algorithm's development. When the motion sensor detects activity in front of the door, the camera is activated, and the system gathers camera feeds and sends the images to three algorithms for analysis. If any two or all of the algorithm's results match the image in the database, the door unlocks; otherwise, it remains locked. The development of this system aims to enhance accuracy by combining three algorithms and to provide consumers with data about what is happening in front of their home via a smart door lock system.},

IoT applications are very helpful for the delivery of healthcare since they allow for safe and real-time remote patient monitoring enhancing people's lives. The goal of this study is to create an embedded system for tracking patients with chronic diseases that require regular checkups. This embedded system uses a Raspberry Pi 4b to gather data from several sensors installed in patients' bodies, and their data is constantly saved, analyzed and processed to extract vital details about their health and transfer it safely with the help of security encryption to the IoT cloud where it is organized into an interface making it easier to use and understand, which allows users like doctors to easily access patients' data and observing their health state from any place in the world. To enhance the functionality of the system, a warning system has been integrated into the IoT platform, which warns the doctor when the patient enters an abnormal state. A notification is also delivered to the doctor's mobile device if any parameter's value exceeds the cutoff. Because of this, IOT-based real-time health monitoring systems meticulously check patient health and, when necessary, save lives.},

In essence, the public network is more vulnerable and the information transferred to systems is not properly encrypted. Furthermore, the network is accessible to anyone those who have the understanding of the computer network. The intruders may use the public network to plough the freedom users from surfing internet by blocking with their websites or advertisements. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network that uses their encryption mechanism to link two different networks together using public telecommunications and to providing services through World Wide Web.

  abstract={In today's world, where everyone wants to keep their valuables safe and secure, video surveillance for observing a particular area has become the need of the hour. To address this problem, we have come up with a solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places, it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs. Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security from hackers.},

  abstract={The popularity and demand of home automation has increased exponentially in recent years because of the ease it provides. Recently, development has been done in this domain and few systems have been proposed that either use voice assistants or application for controlling the electrical appliances. However; less emphasis is laid on power efficiency and this system cannot be integrated with the existing appliances and hence, the entire system needs to be upgraded adding to a lot of additional cost in purchasing new appliances. In this research, the objective is to design such a system that emphasises on power efficiency as well as can be integrated with the already existing appliances. NodeMCU, along with Raspberry Pi, Firebase realtime database, is used to create a system that accomplishes such endeavours and can control relays, which can control these appliances without the need of replacing them. The experiments in this paper demonstrate triggering of electrical appliances using voice assistant, fire alarm on the basis of flame sensor and temperature sensor. Moreover; use of android application was presented for operating electrical appliances from a remote location. Lastly, the system can be modified by adding security cameras, smart blinds, robot vacuums etc.},

  abstract={Security is an essential aspect for an individual or an organisation. Public places like institutions, organisations, banks, parks, etc or even homes need to be guarded to prevent theft or an attack. It is impossible for a single guard to man all the probable locations of intrusions at the same time for 24 hours and adding multiple guards will increase operational costs thereby adding financial burden on institutions. CCTVs are a static mode of surveillance as they are immovable and it needs multiple devices to be set up to completely cover an area. We aim to provide a solution by developing an IoT based Smart Surveillance System. This system consists of a robot with wheels attached which makes it mobile in nature and has an ultrasonic sensor mounted for object detection and the components are controlled by Arduino UNO. Also the robot has a camera mounted on top for Face Detection and the camera is controlled by Raspberry Pi. The system displays a live video feed and also notifies the user if a face is detected on the video feed, by raising an alarm and also on registered email along with the last captured frame. Thus, our system will help in safeguarding important places with minimal effort and will provide timely updates.},

  abstract={Legacy-infrared (IR) devices are pervasively used. They are often controlled by IR remotes and cannot be controlled over the Internet. A trustworthy and cost-effective smart IR system that is able to change an IR controllable device into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) device and interconnect them for smart city/home applications is offered in this article. First, a printed circuit board (PCB) consisting of an IR receiver and multiple IR transmitters side by side which are capable of transmitting about 20 m indoors is designed and implemented. This IR transceiver board is the first of its kind. Second, the IR transceiver can be linked up with a Raspberry Pi, for which we develop two software tools, recording and replaying any IR signals so as to put the corresponding IR device in control. Third, a smartphone can be connected to the Pi by means of a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) cloud server so that the commands can be sent by the smartphone to the legacy IR device over the Internet. We have also identified the deficiency of TLS mutual authentication implemented by the popular MQTT open-source package Mosquitto for a trustworthy IoT system and patched the system. We analyze the factors that affect the IR signal transmission distance, discuss the security concerns of our IR transceiver, and illustrate the scenarios for attacks. For instance, TV can be turned off remotely by a drone equipped with the transceiver.},

  abstract={Creative common license (CCL) based microcontroller platforms boards with various processing capacities and handling of a plethora of I/O are available in the market at various levels of complexities and prices. These CCL based microcontroller platforms boards are increasingly used, predominantly in the academia, for sensor networking as well as handling complex IoT (Internet of Things) functions. This paper looks into a case study of incorporating Arduino and Raspberry Pi for sensor networking, data transmission and enabling IoT functionalities. As a practical realization, an experimental smart home is realized with an array of sensors and a system architecture consisting of a set of Arduino and Raspberry Pi modules. The paper presents necessary aspects of codes in the form of pseudo-codes and describes some aspects of I/O with respect to the sensors used. Finally, the security problems are also addressed. Depending on the time available, a real system will be operated during the presentation of the paper.},

  abstract={Many studies have indicated that due to the inadequacy of proper protection systems, malicious parties could easily breach the household security systems. The issue with all of these security systems is that they allow the use of weak passwords most of them required only six alphanumeric character passwords with no auto-lock function after a number of failed authentication attempts.The overall purpose of this research is to build a smart lock system using the IoT , embedded systems and machine learning, which secures all entrances in the house by a facial recognition system. The device has been constructed based on Raspberry-pi 4 to render the home only accessible to the registered members in the system. We aim to curtail the number of burglaries in households providing a safe place for people. The idea behind the device is safeguard the house against intrusions, burglary. This system is designed to enhance the protection of homes , with the help of this device, we will be able to make residences more secure.},

  abstract={Smart Grid is a major element of the Smart City concept that enables two-way communication of energy data between electric utilities and their consumers. These communication technologies are going through sharp modernization to meet future demand growth and to achieve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid. In this paper, we implement an IPv6 based two-way communication system between the transformer agent (TA), installed at local electric transformer and various customer agents (CAs), connected to customer's smart meter. Various homes share their energy usage with the TA which in turn sends the utility's recommendations to the CAs. Raspberry Pi is used as hardware for all the CAs and the TA. We implement a self-healing mesh network between all nodes using OpenLab IEEE 802.15.4 chips and Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and the data is secured by RSA/AES keys. Several tests have been conducted in real environments, inside and outside of Carleton University, to test the performance of this communication network in various obstacle settings. In this paper, we highlight the details behind the implementation of this IPv6-based smart grid communication system, the related challenges, and the proposed solutions.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is being used more and more nowadays. While this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart homes or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi configured as a network router. We describe the necessary steps to conFigure the proposed security infrastructure, some possible attacks (e.g. SQL-injection, DoS, brute-force attacks) and defense strategies we developed against them.},
