Abstract = {The Smart mirror is a system in which the regular mirror is converted
   into a smart device. The Smart mirror is designed using Raspberry Pi and
   a touch enabled screen. The designed system is capable of acting like a
   regular mirror in case of normal mode of operation and it acts like a
   smart mirror in a triggered mode of operation. The Smart mirror thus
   designed is an interactive system which is capable of accepting two
   modes of input namely touch and mobile based controls. The system is
   designed to display weather information, temperature and latest news on
   the mirror. The system is primarily designed as a home Security and
   Human Monitoring system. The proposed design is thought of as a package
   bundled with better features, which not only just displays information
   over screen, but also can be used for providing security. The system is
   built using hardware units like Raspberry Pi 3 model, touch screen,
   mobile device, camera and Python coding is used for software part. The
   system provides security against Intrusion in home. It is done using
   Background Subtraction along with Simple Frame Difference Approach. Once
   Intrusion is detected the administrator is sent alert message along with
   the photo of intruder. The Human Monitoring is implemented using Machine
   learning technique Yolo with OpenCV. During human monitoring mode of
   operation, if the Human under monitoring moves out of the vision range
   of camera, the administrator of Smart Mirror will be sent alert message.
   Using the mobile commands, the administrator can see the video streaming
   using camera fixed on the Smart Mirror.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things(IoT) has made it possible to set up a smart home
   security through which you can decide who can enter your home using your
   smartphone and web application. It's also made it simple and relatively
   affordable to monitor your home anytime and anywhere. the key issue in a
   traditional home security system is, it is easily breakable and quite
   outdated. This in turns, results in the robbery and also needs
   installation of the costly security system. To tackle this problem, we
   propose a smart home security system, which is IoT as well as face
   recognition enabled. In our system, the web camera is used which is
   connected to the raspberry pi accompanied by sensors such as Passive
   Infrared(Pir) and Ultrasonic sensor. On motion detection camera captures
   an image of the person in front of the door then real-time face
   recognition is done using local binary pattern (LBP). If person's image
   matches with one of the home members then the door will unlock, else
   doorbell will ring. if an intruder tries to break door then an alarm
   will be raised at the same time SMS and Email containing image of the
   intruder will be sent to the homeowner. Face recognition works well in
   multi-face recognition and stranger identification, which meet the
   requirement of home security. This system is battery powered in case of
   power failure. Furthermore, the house owner can keep track of activity
   happening in the house using android and web application connected to
   the raspberry pi using the internet. Using Android application or web
   application owner can also add new person's faces into the databases
   eg., guests.},

Abstract = {Signatures play a crucial role in human life as part of their identity.
   Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the smart home system using the
   Internet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, signature recognition and
   verification can play essential roles in finance, banking, home system,
   insurance, and others. This paper's main objective is to design and
   implement a signature recognition system on a single board computer,
   i.e., Raspberry Pi 3 equipped with an LCD touchscreen. First, the
   acquired signature image was cropped and resized. Next, a binary image
   was extracted as features to train the artificial neural network (ANN).
   The trained ANN was used to classify the input signature to determine
   whether the signature is genuine or forged. Results showed that the
   recognition rate of 99.77\% was achieved using a confidence level
   threshold of 85\% during testing.},

Abstract = {Technology has changed the world. There is a huge growth in technology
   connected to almost every field. The pace and diversity of advancement
   is very rapid. Hence, new technology and techniques are coming up and
   are put to use as per the need. In such advanced scenario, providing
   security to home has also become a major point of concern. Presently
   security cameras can be used for the same. But such cameras may be
   visible to intruders and there is possibility that cameras may be
   damaged. Hence, in order to serve the purpose, there is a need to find
   an alternative secure, accurate and quick method. Hence, an effort is
   made in this paper to design a home security system using Raspberry Pi.
   System requires Raspberry Pi, Camera, Touch screen and android mobile as
   hardware components. Python, Node.js and OpenCV libraries are used for
   software coding. Usually most of the intrusion detection systems click
   the photo of intruders as soon as the human is detected. But, such
   systems fail to click photos, so that the intruder can be identified
   (Face View Photo) and visible. In proposed system, a proper illustrative
   method is proposed so that the intrusion detection is accurate and
   photos thus captured are clear, so that intruder is clearly visible. The
   proposed system is designed as a smart mirror which will provide both
   information and home security. The system is developed to accept touch
   and mobile commands. As soon as the intrusion is detected, an alert
   message along with the identifiable and clear photo (Face view) of
   intruder will be sent to the owner's/administrator's mobile. The mirror
   owner can also see the video of deployed environment through the camera
   fitted on smart mirror. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware
   platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for
   Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home automation and security systems.
   These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is
   made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as
   motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for
   security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and
   other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This
   paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor
   that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open
   events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses
   an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with
   the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that
   implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the
   implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed
   as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from
   other radio frequency devices. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous technology that
   connects a large number of devices together for people to be more
   convenient from using of new technologies. However, having these devices
   connected to the Internet may expose them to various risks malicious and
   suspicious attacks. In addition, after the device installation, these
   devices normally do not receive full security measurement, resulting in
   becoming the attacking and intruding targets. This research studies and
   focuses on the security threats in smart home networks by using
   Raspberry Pi which is low cost and portable. Our system, which is called
   PITI, performs hybrid detection by combining Snort IDS and
   behavior-based profile analysis together in order to efficiently detect
   malicious and suspicious traffic. The current version of PITI can alert
   anomaly traffic by showing a message on the screen and also alert by
   sounds. For the future work, PITI device should be developed into
   Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which can drop the suspicious packets
   and detect more type of attacks.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is moving us towards smart homes for more
   security and energy efficiency. This paper presents design and
   implementation of a ubiquitous home controlling and monitoring system
   that uses an inexpensive Raspberry PI as the home automation hub to
   connect with various household devices. Via smartphones or tablets, home
   owners can remotely and continuously monitor their home environment
   including temperature, humidity, security, and energy consumption and
   adjust it to a desired level, thereby gaining more security and energy
   saving. As an initial step, we evaluated and compared three IoT
   application layer protocols REST, CoAP and MQTT and our findings suggest
   MQTT outperforms the other two in the smart home we aim to build.
   Moreover, using a Raspberry PI as the home automation hub can overcome
   the interoperability challenges facing commercial home automation
   components. Our experience shows that the line of code (LOC) for adding
   a new device to the home automation hub is about 60 lines of Java code.
   We hope this work can benefit research in the smart home. The source
   code for this work is online available for access.},

Abstract = {Internet of things and Automation systems have taken over the world at
   present times. Home security has always been a field of concern among
   mass people. Making home security systems safer, cheaper and easy to
   understand is a challenge that many engineers around the world are
   striving to achieve in developing countries. Considering the economic
   condition of people of a developing country like Bangladesh, we propose
   an IoT based smart home security and automation system named `Facebook
   messenger Chatbot' which is made using Raspberry PI as the central
   processor. It will enable its users to use it free of cost as Facebook
   messenger app is free in Bangladesh. People can use it from home or any
   remote location and can control digital home appliances like fans,
   lights etc. Smart door locking system, face recognition, gas leakage
   detection, temperature detection and control, humidity detection, fire
   detection, which has been done through collecting data from different
   sensors and passing them to Raspberry PI and then PI passes these to the
   BOT through a REST API, are the additional features that make our
   security system safer, effective and easier to use compared to other
   existing approaches.},

Abstract = {An emerging technology that makes the world smarter is the Internet of
   Things (IoT). The growth of the IoT network has enriched the home and
   lifestyle with its associated technologies. Life today revolves around
   the notion of automation and the items that are automated are said to be
   of the next generation because they decrease human intervention. The
   technology of the home automation system is unique to other systems that
   allow the user to control the system through an internet connection from
   any location around the world. The proposed work reflects the many IoT
   applications that use Raspberry pi, sensors, IoT module to design the
   smart home automation and home security monitoring framework. The smart
   home automation system uses an android smartphone to easily control home
   appliances from any location around the world through an internet
   connection and will act as a smart monitoring security module for home
   security monitoring. Traditional surveillance systems only record
   motion-based movements, but the proposed system serves the function of
   facial recognition to minimize the error caused by motion detection, and
   since it records automatically only during motion detection, the system
   saves a lot of storage space. Once the motion is detected by the PIR
   Sensor and the image is sent to the Android app via Raspberry pi, the
   Raspberry pi camera module is used to capture photos. This device can
   track when motion is detected and scans for the faces caught in the
   picture and operates with the aid of the door for face recognition. The
   key benefit is that the owner can seek surveillance from any part of the
   globe and can take action according to the circumstances.},

Abstract = {Before inception of Internet of Things (IoT), personal computers and
   laptop were used to handle daily tasks of individuals like mail surfing,
   access to bank portal, observing current temperature, among others.
   Nowadays, IoTenabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and
   tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in
   IoT. Smart homes have been widely accepted by individuals and
   organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security
   systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of
   home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user
   to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that
   ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home
   security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like:
   delay, non -web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of
   alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the
   home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security
   systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to
   the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other
   latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home
   more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence,
   considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed
   an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home
   in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody
   is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small
   pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the
   delay during process of e-mail alert. This paper also confirms the
   advantage of Raspberry Pi flexibility and broad probability of its
   usage. Preliminary analyses have shown encouraging results.},

Abstract = {Locally networked or remotely controlled home automation system becomes
   a popular paradigm because of the numerous advantages and is suitable
   for academic research. This paper proposes a method for an
   implementation of Raspberry Pi based home automation system presented
   with an android phone access interface. The power consumption profile
   across the connected load is measured accurately through programming.
   Users can access the graph of total power consumption with respect to
   time worldwide using their Dropbox account. An android application has
   been developed to channelize the monitoring and controlling operation of
   home appliances remotely. This application facilitates controlling of
   operating pins of Raspberry Pi by pressing the corresponding key for
   turning ``on{''} and ``off{''} of any desired appliance. Systems can
   range from the simple room lighting control to smart microcontroller
   based hybrid systems incorporating several other additional features.
   Smart home automation systems are being adopted to achieve flexibility,
   scalability, security in the sense of data protection through the
   cloud-based data storage protocol, reliability, energy efficiency, etc.},

Abstract = {The idea of a smart home is getting attention for the last few years.
   The key challenges in a smart home are intelligent decision making,
   secure identification, and authentication of the IoT devices, continuous
   connectivity, data security, and privacy issues. The existing systems
   are targeting one or two of these issues whereas a smart home automation
   system that is not only secure but also has intelligent decision making
   and analytical abilities is the need of time. In this paper, we present
   a novel idea of a smart home that uses a machine learning algorithm
   (Support Vector Machine) for intelligent decision making and also uses
   blockchain technology to ensure identification and authentication of the
   IoT devices. Emerging blockchain technology plays a vital role by
   providing a reliable, secure, and decentralized mechanism for
   identification and authentication of the IoT devices used in the
   proposed home automation system. Moreover, the SVM classifier is applied
   to classify the status of devices used in the proposed smart home
   automation system into one of the two categories, i.e., ``ON{''} and
   ``OFF.{''} This system is based on Raspberry Pi, 5 V relay circuit, and
   some sensors. A mobile application is developed using the Android
   platform. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of
   each appliance. The HTTP web interface and apache server are used for
   communication among the Android app and Raspberry Pi. The proposed idea
   is tested in the lab and real life to validate its effectiveness and
   usefulness. It is also ensured that the hardware and technology used in
   the proposed idea are cheap, easily available, and replicable. The
   experimental results highlight its significance and validate the proof
   of the concept.},

Abstract = {For the past few years, the concept of the smart house has gained
   popularity. The major challenges concerning a smart home include data
   security, privacy issues, authentication, secure identification, and
   automated decision-making of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
   Currently, existing home automation systems address either of these
   challenges, however, home automation that also involves automated
   decision -making systems and systematic features apart from being
   reliable and safe is an absolute necessity. The current study proposes a
   deep learning-driven smart home system that integrates a Convolutional
   neural network (CNN) for automated decision-making such as classifying
   the device as ``ON{''} and ``OFF{''} based on its utilization at home.
   Additionally, to provide a decentralized, secure, and reliable mechanism
   to assure the authentication and identification of the IoT devices we
   integrated the emerging blockchain technology into this study. The
   proposed system is fundamentally comprised of a variety of sensors, a 5
   V relay circuit, and Raspberry Pi which operates as a server and
   maintains the database of each device being used. Moreover, an android
   application is developed which communicates with the Raspberry Pi
   interface using the Apache server and HTTP web interface. The
   practicality of the proposed system for home automation is tested and
   evaluated in the lab and in real-time to ensure its efficacy. The
   current study also assures that the technology and hardware utilized in
   the proposed smart house system are inexpensive, widely available, and
   scalable. Furthermore, the need for a more comprehensive security and
   privacy model to be incorporated into the design phase of smart homes is
   highlighted by a discussion of the risks analysis' implications
   including cyber threats, hardware security, and cyber attacks. The
   experimental results emphasize the significance of the proposed system
   and validate its usability in the real world.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the home security by remote control means is a cutting-edge
   research area in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT's). The necessity
   of security is increasing these days, ranging from thefts, burglary,
   accidents, LPG gas leakage and fire detection etc, which all are
   important aspects of a Home Security System. In this paper, a prototype
   Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home (SSH) model is developed. Generally
   a home security system uses signals in terms of alarm of intruder
   detection. However, the proposed Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home
   uses a mobile communication (GSM) based Home Security System, which
   helps to provide a better security to have systems that can be globally
   connected. In the proposed system a text message is sent, whenever an
   event from any sensor is detected, so that immediate actions could be
   taken by the home owner. The proposed SSH sends SMS using GSM-Module and
   mail through Raspberry Pi micro-controller. The prototype SSH based
   smart system also uses an Arduino micro-controller board for commands
   processing and control. The system uses GSM technology, which provides
   global access to the Smart Home Security System. The prototype SSH,
   developed at a low cost, can be used for converting existing homes into
   smart homes at relatively affordable cost and with convenience. The
   performance testing results of the prototype SSH are encouraging.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) combines the idea of technology providing
   value to our daily lives. One major category in which technology
   benefits us is the concept of security and privacy. Smartphones can act
   as a security alert system as the smartphone is the most widely-used
   smart device. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI)integrated smart IoT devices has significantly increased as well. In
   this paper, we developed a smart IoT security system for the smart-home.
   In which, a Raspberry Pi acts as a security system with a No Infrared
   (NoIR) Pi Camera Module to record videos and capture images. Also, a
   Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensor is used to detect motion. We
   propose to use motion sensor data and the images gathered from the NoIR
   Pi Camera Module to predict a security threat using a face recognition
   classification technique along with our developed algorithm. The system
   has the capability to notify the user in case of any emergency. The
   proposed system can detect any security threat with an accuracy of
   95.5\% and a precision of 91\%.},

Abstract = {There is rapid interest growing in the use of smart, connected devices.
   The developing world market for smart technology is evolving to adopt
   and adapt to the interconnected world of devices leading to the Internet
   of Things (IoT) everywhere. This research paper presents the design,
   development, and deployment of a prototype for the secure wireless home
   automation system with OpenHAB 2. We employed the use of two (2)
   high-performance microcontrollers, namely, the Arduino Mega 2560,
   interfaced with a 16-channel relay, and Raspberry Pi Model B, running
   the OpenHAB software. The Raspberry Pi functioned as the server to
   develop a prototype of an automated smart home that is remotely
   controllable from both a web application and an Android mobile app. In
   designing a wireless controlled switch for home appliances, two security
   procedures were implemented, namely, the token-based JSON Web Token
   (JWT) interface and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) procedures for
   authentication and data encryption. Our system delivered a home
   automation system that leverages on the power of the latest version of
   OpenHAB to maximize productivity and overall home security while making
   it adaptable to the management of individual devices. When tested, both
   the developed hardware and software modules performed extremely well to
   meet the goal of a secured home automation system. Industry-standard
   penetration testing tools and frameworks, including Aircrack-ng, were
   utilized; wireless network audit began with a full sweep of the wireless
   frequencies with excellent results. It also ensures the efficient use of
   energy in the home as devices are intelligently controlled from both
   mobile and web applications. The results of the design and
   implementation of the additional layer for the security of the OpenHAB
   framework provide various theoretical and practical implications for
   home automation.},

Abstract = {Urban households have better security options compared to rural
   households. Closed-Circuited Television (CCTV) is a surveillance tool
   designed to assist in monitoring events. However, the passive monitoring
   feature of CCTV does not provide any feedback nor respond to the user
   when a crime incident arises. Thus, a low-cost intruder system with
   Raspberry Pi which adopts a similar feature and functionality for a home
   security system is proposed. This is by integrating the feature of the
   OpenCV library to the Pi Camera to enhance the overall functionality.
   The use of sensors like a magnetic switch for door and PIR sensors allow
   the home security system to take in feedback regarding the environment.
   This will serve as a security layer or enhancement for the home security
   measurements. The proposed system will help to remedy the passive
   monitoring feature of CCTV as a smarter and intelligent home security
   system. The system will be developed in an iteration process and
   prototyping test will be conducted.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a smart and robust home security system. This
   is for intrusion detection along with a proprietary Android application.
   Intruder-Spi makes use of relatively low cost but effective wireless
   sensors network that makes it an affordable security system to buy when
   compared to other expensive CCTV camera systems. This implements a home
   security automated intrusion detection system which alerts the host
   using `Twilio' API. The detection system comprises of a laser tripwire.
   The android application has been developed using the Python programming
   language on the server side and Java is being used to develop the
   application on the client side. The system notifies the user about any
   possible theft or intrusion in one's environment by clicking pictures
   and recording a video for a period using a proprietary Raspberry Pi
   camera and storing it into the MySQL database in the Raspberry Pi
   itself. Apache2 is the web-server being used on the Pi to serve client
   requests being made from the Android device which will eventually show
   the respective captured images and videos to the registered users who
   can then control the application remotely.},

Abstract = {About half a billion households are expected to use smart home systems
   by 2025. Although many IoT sensors, such as smoke detectors or security
   cameras, are available and governmental crisis warning systems are in
   place, little is known about how to warn appropriately in smart home
   environments. We created a Raspberry Pi based prototype with a speaker,
   a display, and a connected smart light bulb. Together with a focus
   group, we developed a taxonomy for warning messages in smart home
   environments, dividing them into five classes with different stimuli. We
   evaluated the taxonomy using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) in a
   field study at participants' (N = 13) homes testing 331 warnings. The
   results show that taxonomy-based warning stimuli are perceived to be
   appropriate and participants could imagine using such a warning system.
   We propose a deeper integration of warning capabilities into smart home
   environments to enhance the safety of citizens.},

Abstract = {The authenticated door-lock security system for smart-home is a critical
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) application. The most pressing bottleneck of
   running algorithms in IoT devices is the availability of low computation
   resources. The state-of-the-art algorithms which work significantly well
   in high-end computing unit more often fail to operate in IoT devices
   like Raspberry pi. This work targets design of a face authenticated
   door-lock security system in Raspberry pi and, therefore, evaluates the
   performance of conventional face detection and recognition models. The
   local binary pattern histogram (LBPH), eigenface and fisherface
   algorithms are considered for evaluation. The evaluation analyzes the
   accuracy of a model in detecting human faces, its computation time and
   vulnerability to photo hacking while implemented in Raspberry pi
   platform. It covers a large number of stored faces and the cases of
   variation in angle and illumination in the face image. The python and
   c(++) bindings to the opencv framework are considered to create a fully
   functional face recognition system hardware.},

Abstract = {The advances on recent communication paradigms brings new security and
   privacy challenges, mainly about personal data collection by smart
   devices. Resource constrained devices face serious issues to run complex
   cryptographic algorithms. Trying to evaluate the performance impact of
   those algorithms in usual and common devices used in smart homes, in
   this paper we tested the impact of different cryptographic algorithms in
   low computational devices, typically used in smart devices applied in
   smart homes, testing different security configurations and using the two
   most used transport protocols (HTTP and MQTT). The experiment measures
   their effects on six commonly used embedded devices in IoT WSNs:
   ESP8622, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi (RPi) from 1 to 4. The experiment
   measured the power consumption, message delay, and additional message
   length (bytes). Moreover, the analysis was also used to model security
   algorithms. The experimental results from long runs (72 hours) reveal
   the cryptographic solution choice is significant for the message delay
   and additional message length.},

Abstract = {Smart home technology is gaining popularity among end-users, as it
   allows them to remotely control a variety of devices in their homes.
   Such systems have obvious benefits in terms of automation, but at the
   same time pose significant threats to home owners if the underlying
   communications are not secure. To this end, we introduce a novel
   security protocol that simplifies the pairwise authentication and key
   exchange among smart home devices. The protocol leverages identity-based
   cryptography (IBC), thus relaxing the requirement for storing and
   managing public key certificates. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks
   associated with centralized key generation in IBC, we opt to generate
   the private keys in a distributed manner, involving all smart devices.
   We implemented our protocol on Raspberry Pi 3 devices and demonstrate
   its efficiency in terms of both computational and communication cost.},

   provide an alarming system that has the ability to notify the owner, as
   well as, recognizing guests by giving them a user-id. In this vein, the
   authorized individuals are only the ones who will get the permission to
   access the doors. The system works by taking snaps for the guest through
   a code and camera pi positioned in the doors then, such snaps will be
   sent to the owner. The proposed system can be extended to be used for

Abstract = {Due to emerging disruptive technologies, Internet of Things (IoT) play a
   vital role for smart living domains, for examples, elderly and
   disabilities healthcare services and home safety and security monitoring
   and automation control services. These systems will send automatically
   an emergency call with home user information and location as a privacy
   data to public services like hospitals, police offices, or fire
   departments. This paper introduces emergency service for a Smart Home
   System (SHS) based on Ethereum blockchain with smart contract for
   decentralized handling access control among untrusted public services so
   called Home Service Providers (HSPs) and smart home IoT devices. Our SHS
   testbed consists of (1) smart home sensor manger equipped with Raspberry
   Pi (RPi) represented as an edge IoT gateway for gathering environmental
   sensor data, (2) HSP miners deployed Meteor and Ethereum platform, and
   (3) web-based applications for home users and HSP staffs. Furthermore,
   our contribution includes the integration of digital signature for the
   IoT device authentication, the One Time Passcode with QR code for HSP
   staff access control, and IPFS for manipulating emergency call from SHS
   in peers. Our implementation results focusing on HSP miners will be
   presented and analysed.},

   Homes},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {176-190},
Abstract = {The rapid proliferation of embedded devices has led to the growth of the
   Internet of Things (IoT) with applications in numerous domains such as
   home automation, healthcare, education and agriculture. However, many of
   the connected devices particularly in smart homes are the target of
   attacks that try to exploit security vulnerabilities such as hard-coded
   passwords and insecure data transfer. Recent studies show that there is
   a considerable surge in the number of phishing attacks targeting smart
   homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many of the existing user
   authentication protocols in the literature incur additional
   computational overhead and need to be made more resilient to smart home
   targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight and
   privacy-preserving remote user authentication protocol for securing
   smart home applications. Our approach is based on Photo Response
   Non-Uniformity (PRNU) to make our protocol resilient to smart home
   attacks such as smartphone capture attacks and phishing attacks. In
   addition, the lightweight nature of our solution is suitable for
   deployment on heterogeneous and resource constrained IoT devices.
   Besides, we leverage geometric secret sharing for establishing mutual
   authentication among the participating entities. We validate the
   security of the proposed protocol using the AVISPA formal verification
   tool and prototype it on a Raspberry Pi to analyze the power
   consumption. Finally, a comparison with existing schemes reveals that
   our scheme incurs a 20\% reduction in communication overhead on smart
   devices. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is usable as it absolves users
   from memorizing passwords and carrying smart cards.},

Abstract = {In the digital era of mobile technology, smart light control via voice
   and motion on the internet of things through the use of Raspberry Pi may
   assist them in managing their daily lives more conveniently,
   efficiently, and securely. The security of their lives and possessions
   is critical. The primary objective of this research is to design and
   develop a smart light control and intruder detection system using
   Raspberry Pi based on the internet of things. The proposed prototype
   supports Wi-Fi and 4G mobile connections in a home or outdoor
   environment. The methodology used in this study is for manual control of
   on-off lights and detection of an intruder with a range of response
   times, including low, medium, and high response delays (1, 2.5, and 5
   seconds). The testing results compare the Average Response Time and the
   Average Effectiveness Response Time for mobile connections over 4G and
   Wi-Fi. The results support the on-off lights, with response accuracy
   rates of 78 percent, 84 percent, and 100 percent for Thai and English
   voice commands on Google Assistance and the Blynk mobile application,
   respectively. As a result, the research examines the response time for
   various environments with varying levels of mobile communication. The
   proposed system has designed and evaluated a prototype of smart light
   control and intruder detection using the Internet of Things. This
   prototype can be used in daily life to increase convenience, reduce time
   spent on tasks, reduce costs, and increase security.},

   cut across many areas of modern-day living and enabled interconnection

   an interoperable Internet-of-Things (IoTs) platform for a smart home
   system using a Web-of-Objects (WoO) and cloud architecture. The proposed
   platform controls the home appliances from anywhere and also provides
   the homes' data in the cloud for various service providers' applications
   and analysis. Firstly, we proposed a Raspberry PI based gateway for
   interoperability among various legacy home appliances, different
   communication technologies, and protocols. Secondly, we bring the smart
   home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the
   Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we
   will provide the cloud server for smart homes' to store the homes' data
   due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for
   various application's service providers and analysis. In the proposed
   smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee
   communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP
   camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for
   web-based controlling. We aim to reduce the human intervention, secure
   access control to home devices from anywhere, provide smart homes data
   for application services as well as for analysis, and improve the
   utilization of resources.},

Abstract = {Smart home applications are ubiquitous and have gained popularity due to
   the overwhelming use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technology. The
   revolution in technologies has made homes more convenient, efficient,
   and even more secure. The need for advancement in smart home technology
   is necessary due to the scarcity of intelligent home applications that
   cater to several aspects of the home simultaneously, i.e., automation,
   security, safety, and reducing energy consumption using less bandwidth,
   computation, and cost. Our research work provides a solution to these
   problems by deploying a smart home automation system with the
   applications mentioned above over a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi
   (RPI) device. The RPI is used as a central controlling unit, which
   provides a cost-effective platform for interconnecting a variety of
   devices and various sensors in a home via the Internet. We propose a
   cost-effective integrated system for smart home based on IoT and
   Edge-Computing paradigm. The proposed system provides remote and
   automatic control to home appliances, ensuring security and safety.
   Additionally, the proposed solution uses the edge-computing paradigm to
   store sensitive data in a local cloud to preserve the customer's
   privacy. Moreover, visual and scalar sensor-generated data are processed
   and held over edge device (RPI) to reduce bandwidth, computation, and
   storage cost. In the comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, the
   proposed system is 5\% faster in detecting motion, and 5 ms and 4 ms in
   switching relay on and off, respectively. It is also 6\% more efficient
   than the existing solutions with respect to energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) systems are slowly but steadily becoming part
   of different aspects of our lives, with their applications ranging from
   smart homes, to wearable devices, to healthcare, etc. Traditional
   cryptographic schemes might not be suitable to be implemented on
   resource limited IoT devices. The decision to utilize a certain
   cryptographic algorithm, is mainly based on a tradeoff between security
   and performance, i.e. power consumption. A benchmark of these different
   cryptographic algorithms on IoT platforms is a must for security
   architects while designing their protocols and schemes. This paper
   presents a benchmark of the most known cryptographic algorithms on the
   Raspberry Pi platform, with a comparison with Arduino benchmark results
   provided in the literature.},

Abstract = {Creative common license (CCL) based microcontroller platforms boards
   with various processing capacities and handling of a plethora of I/O are
   available in the market at various levels of complexities and prices.
   These CCL based microcontroller platforms boards are increasingly used,
   predominantly in the academia, for sensor networking as well as handling
   complex IoT (Internet of Things) functions. This paper looks into a case
   study of incorporating Arduino and Raspberry Pi for sensor networking,
   data transmission and enabling IoT functionalities. As a practical
   realization, an experimental smart home is realized with an array of
   sensors and a system architecture consisting of a set of Arduino and
   Raspberry Pi modules. The paper presents necessary aspects of codes in
   the form of pseudo-codes and describes some aspects of I/O with respect
   to the sensors used. Finally, the security problems are also addressed.
   Depending on the time available, a real system will be operated during
   the presentation of the paper.},

Abstract = {During the last decade the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) based
   applications inspired the world by providing state of the art solutions
   to many common problems. From traffic management systems to urban cities
   planning and development, IoT based home monitoring systems, and many
   other smart applications. Regardless of these facilities, most of these
   IoT based solutions are data driven and results in small accuracy values
   for smaller datasets. In order to address this problem, this paper
   presents deep learning based hybrid approach for the development of an
   IoT-based intelligent home security and appliance control system in the
   smart cities. This hybrid model consists of; convolution neural network
   and binary long short term model for the object detection to ensure
   safety of the homes while IoT based hardware components like; Raspberry
   Pi, Amazon Web services cloud, and GSM modems for remotely accessing and
   controlling of the home appliances. An android application is developed
   and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud for the remote
   monitoring of home appliances. A GSM device and Message queuing
   telemetry transport (MQTT) are integrated for communicating with the
   connected IoT devices to ensure the online and offline communication.
   For object detection purposes a camera is connected to Raspberry Pi
   using the proposed hybrid neural network model. The applicability of the
   proposed model is tested by calculating results for the object at
   varying distance from the camera and for different intensity levels of
   the light. Besides many applications the proposed model promises for
   providing optimum results for the small amount of data and results in
   high recognition rates of 95.34\% compared to the conventional
   recognition model (k nearest neighbours) recognition rate of 76\%.},

Abstract = {In recent years considerable progress has been made in the area of face
   recognition. Through the work of computer science engineers, computers
   can now outperform humans in many face recognition tasks, particularly
   those in which large databases of faces must be searched. A system with
   the ability to detect and recognize faces has many potential
   applications including crowd and airport surveillance, private security
   and improved human-computer interaction. An automatic face recognition
   system is perfectly suited to fix security issues and offer flexibility
   to smart house control. This project aims to replace costly image
   processing boards using Raspberry pi board with ARMv7 Cortex-A7 as the
   core within Opencv library. This project is mainly based on image
   processing by porting the Opencv library to the Raspberry Pi board.
   Algorithm for face recognition, based on principal component analysis
   (PCA), is programmed and implemented on the platform. The system is
   based on the criteria of low power consumption, resources optimization,
   and improved operation speed.
   This paper reviews the related work in the field of home automation
   systems and presents the system design, software algorithm,
   implementation and results.},

Abstract = {Infrared (IR) remote control is a widely used technology at home due to
   its simplicity and low cost. Most considered it to be ``secure{''}
   because of the line-of-sight usage within the home. In this paper, we
   revisit the security of IR remote control schemes and examine their
   security assumptions under the settings of internet-connected smart
   homes. We focus on two specific questions: (1) whether IR signals could
   be sniffed by an IoT device; and (2) what information could be leaked
   out through the sniffed IR control signals.
   To answer these questions, we design a sniff module using a
   commercial-off-the-shelf IR receiver on a Raspberry Pi and show that the
   Infrared (IR) signal emanating from the remote control of a Smart TV can
   be captured by one of the nearby IoT devices, for example, a smart
   air-conditioner, even the signal is not aimed at the air-conditioner.
   The IR signal range and receiving angle are larger than most have
   thought. We also developed algorithms to extract semantic information
   from the sniffed IR control signals, and evaluated with real-world
   applications. The results showed that lots of sensitive information
   could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals, including
   account name and password, PIN code, and even payment information.},

Abstract = {Security is a prime aspect of concern in order to maintain
   confidentially of our home, work places and to avoid intrusion of
   unauthorized persons. In voice password and biometric based
   authentication door locking system, authentication using the unique
   identification like biometric and voice recognition plays a vital role
   to provide high level of security. The finger ridges of individual do
   not match with any other finger ridges and an individual's voice cannot
   be impersonated with accuracy.
   This paper proposes a smart voice password and biometric based security
   system for door locking in smart homes. To enhance the security, in
   place of conventional door locking system, a finger print sensor along
   with a micro phone are used to authenticate, i.e. to lock and unlock the
   doors {[}1]. The data base will maintain the data of the persons who
   tried to access the door. The entire system is controlled by the
   Raspberry pi 3 B+ processor. PIWHO soft ware is used for the purpose of
   voice recognition. Door access may be provided to the registered users
   based on his voice pass word and thumb impression. Door will be opened
   only when both the factors are satisfied, otherwise buzzer will be
   activated and the authorized person will receive an SMS alert message.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the use of various open source hardware such as
   Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. to build smart and secure homes. The
   hardware is open source and hence cost efficient. This home automation

   smartphone, tablet, or any computer. This paper also explains the use of
   the security system for fire hazards that may occur due to a gas leakage
   and can be detected using a smoke sensor. It uses a low power NRF24L
   trans-receiver at each node around the house to create a mesh network
   that connects to a Linux based central hub. Users can monitor the house
   from anywhere and get periodic alerts. In the proposed work, the house
   can also be controlled using voice commands such as Google Voice, Apple
   HomeKit and Alexa.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of a Real-Time Smart Home Management System
   Considering Energy Saving},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {One of the most challenging problems related to the operation of smart
   microgrids is the optimal home energy management scheme with multiple
   and conflicting objectives. Moreover, there is a noticeable increase in
   homes equipped with renewable energy sources (RESs), where the
   coordination of loads and generation can achieve extra savings and
   minimize peak loads. In this paper, a solar-powered smart home with
   optimal energy management is designed in an affordable and secure
   manner, allowing the owner to control the home from remote and local
   sites using their smartphones and PCs. The Raspberry Pi 4 B is used as
   the brain of the proposed smart home automation management system
   (HAMS). It is used to collect the data from the existing sensors and
   store them, and then take the decision. The home is monitored using a
   graphical interface that monitors room temperature, humidity, smoke, and
   lighting through a set of sensors, as well as PIR sensors to monitor the
   people movement. This action enables remote control of all home
   appliances in a safe and emission-free manner. This target is reached
   using Cayenne, which is an IoT platform, in addition to building some
   codes related to some appliances and sensors not supported in Cayenne
   from scratch. Convenience for people with disabilities is considered by
   using the Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa) to control home appliances and the
   charging point by voice, implementing the associated code for connecting
   the Raspberry pi with Alexa from scratch, and simulating the system on
   LabVIEW. To reach the optimal operation and reduce the operating costs,
   an optimization framework for the home energy management system (HEMS)
   is proposed. The operating costs for the day amounted to approximately
   16.039 euro. There is a decrease in the operating costs by about
   23.13\%. The consumption decreased after using the smart HAMS by 18.161
   kWh. The results of the optimization also show that the least area that
   can be used to install solar panels to produce the desired energy with
   the lowest cost is about 118.1039 m(2), which is about 23.62\% of the
   total surface area of the home in which the study was conducted. The
   obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms
   of automation, security, safety, and low operating costs.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is being used more and more nowadays. While
   this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart
   homes or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors
   and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality
   have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there
   is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As
   providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much
   better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the
   network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we
   propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi
   configured as a network router. We describe the necessary steps to
   configure the proposed security infrastructure, some possible attacks
   (e.g. SQL-injection, DoS, brute-force attacks) and defense strategies we
   developed against them.},

   is the defining moment on the grounds that IoT has contrived it
   conceivable to install an ``Identity (Facial) recognition system for

   home. This framework is reasonable and easy to screen your home from
   whenever and anyplace. In this we used set of sensors and devices by
   which we will monitor the visitors of the house and provided timely
   information to the owner through email or message. The owner can forward
   this information to anyone in case of any emergency. This system is
   attached to the main door of the home with the help of PIR sensor it
   detect the moment near the doors by this Raspberry pi triggers and
   capture the image by using pi camera and compare that picture with the
   already stored picture in the database if both are same then only it
   will open the door else it will send the mail or SMS to the owner and
   inform about the intruder at his/her home. The system doesn't allow
   unauthenticated visitors to unlock the door. The owner can give
   authentication to anyone by adding their image to the database. Through
   this model we can avoid intruders and achieve the strongest security

Abstract = {Due to the sheer number and heterogeneity of IoT devices, it is not
   possible to secure the IoT ecosystem using traditional endpoint and
   network security solutions. To address the requirements of securing IoT
   devices in edge home networks, this paper proposed a strategy capable of
   securing the network against most malicious activity in real-time.
   Firstly, we use an edge smart gateway, which is deployed on a
   Raspberry-Pi, runs an SDN controller and Open vSwtich (OVS) to perform
   traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. Then, with
   limited resources available on edge gateway, we use a lightweight
   machine-learning algorithm to classify device to device traffic and
   identify if there is a network intrusion. The classification model
   extracts features of network traffic, trained by classic supervised
   learning method-Decision Tree J48, then distinguish between benign and
   malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. Simulation results
   show that the model has high accuracy of intrusion and can effectively
   ensure security of home IoT interactions.},

Abstract = {Manufacturers of smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices are
   increasingly adding voice assistant and audio monitoring features to a
   wide range of devices including smart speakers, televisions,
   thermostats, security systems, and doorbells. Consequently, many of
   these devices are equipped with microphones, raising significant privacy
   concerns: users may not always be aware of when audio recordings are
   sent to the cloud, or who may gain access to the recordings. In this
   paper, we present the LeakyPick architecture that enables the detection
   of the smart home devices that stream recorded audio to the Internet in
   response to observing a sound. Our proof-of-concept is a LeakyPick
   device that is placed in a user's smart home and periodically
   ``probes{''} other devices in its environment and monitors the
   subsequent network traffic for statistical patterns that indicate audio
   transmission. Our prototype is built on a Raspberry Pi for less than USD
   \$40 and has a measurement accuracy of 94\% in detecting audio
   transmissions for a collection of 8 devices with voice assistant
   capabilities. Furthermore, we used LeakyPick to identify 89 words that
   an Amazon Echo Dot misinterprets as its wake-word, resulting in
   unexpected audio transmission. LeakyPick provides a cost effective
   approach to help regular consumers monitor their homes for
   sound-triggered devices that unexpectedly transmit audio to the cloud.},

   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) offers great research perspective to
   explore communication, computation and controlling of physical devices
   by using real-time processing and analytics. Since CPS like smart home
   involves the integration of several types of sensors and equipment,
   therefore reliability, maintainability, security, data storage and
   cost-effectiveness are some of the critical issues to be addressed. In
   addition, interactivity and dynamic feedback, context correlation with
   respect to streaming events and uncertainties in event composition are
   also identified as major challenging issues. In the present research, a
   model for CPS is proposed which is a voice-controlled smart home. Spoken
   Language Understanding (SLU) plays an important role in dialog system
   for identifying semantic components in user utterance. The research work
   includes stream processing, data collection, identification of actions
   from voice utterance and event-based real-time decision making. The
   study includes deployment of various sensors and actuators for
   performing various actions based on voice commands. Raspberry Pi {[}19]
   is used as a central node to which various sensors and equipment are
   connected. It receives voice command from android device and identifies
   the various intents and slots from the input utterance.},

   has future work the real context experiment, vital signs monitor system
   for smart health tourism that allows to the tourist to visit to local
   interest points without neglect the health treatments and medical
   monitoring. Thus, the system operates inside and outside health
   facilities in order to be possible to get the vital signs of the health
   tourist. Since the data will be acquired outside health facilities an
   information security risk assessmentwasmade and the security measures
   were promoted. The system is composed by many technologies, such as:
   smartwatch, raspberry pi, wireless sensor networks, among others and
   software. The vital signs acquired are temperature, blood pressure,
   heart beat, blood oxygen level and, finally, the accelerometer will be
   used to detect falls. Beside this an adaptive artificial intelligence
   system will be used to predict health problems of the health tourist.},

   Implementations for Secure and Efficient Energy Systems Monitoring},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has assumed a pivotal role in the
   advancement of communication technology and in our daily lives. However,
   an IoT system such as a smart grid with poorly designed topology and
   weak security protocols might be vulnerable to cybercrimes. Exploits may
   arise from sensor data interception en route to the intended consumer
   within an IoT system. The increasing integration of electronic devices
   interconnected via the internet has galvanized the acceptance of this
   technology. Nonetheless, as the number of users of this technology
   surges, there must be an aligned concern to ensure that security
   measures are diligently enforced within IoT communication systems, such
   as in smart homes, smart cities, smart factories, smart hospitals, and
   smart grids. This research addresses security lacunae in the topology
   and configuration of IoT energy monitoring systems using post-quantum
   cryptographic techniques. We propose tailored implementations of the
   Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), N-th degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units
   (NTRU), and a suite of cryptographic primitives based on Module
   LearningWith Rounding (Saber) as post-quantum cryptographic candidate
   algorithms for IoT devices. These aim to secure publisher-subscriber
   end-to-end communication in energy system monitoring. Additionally, we
   offer a comparative analysis of these tailored implementations on
   low-resource devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, during data transmission
   using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Results
   indicate that the customized implementation of NTRU outperforms both
   SABER and RSA in terms of CPU and memory usage, while Light SABER
   emerges as the front-runner when considering encryption and decryption
   delays.},

Title = {IoT based applications for healthcare and home automation},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 14},
Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that involves connecting the
   virtual world of the Internet to the real world through so-called smart
   objects. Indeed, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively
   employed in a wide range of applications, including healthcare field and
   home automation. These objects are equipped with communication
   capabilities and can exchange data over the Internet. In recent times,
   the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge of growth and
   transformation. The integration of IoT-enabled devices has
   revolutionized remote monitoring in healthcare, empowering healthcare
   providers to keep their patients safe and healthy while delivering
   exceptional care. On the other hand, the home automation system is
   becoming increasingly popular due to its many benefits, which involve
   remotely monitoring and controlling household appliances. In fact, the
   main challenges faced by home automation systems are poor manageability,
   rigidity, difficulty in achieving security, and high ownership costs. As
   the internet and its applications continue to grow, there is enormous
   potential for remotely accessing, controlling and monitoring
   network-enabled devices. With this context in mind, the objective of
   this project is to develop two IoT-based models. These models are based
   on Arduino and Raspberry pi boards, cloud, Bluetooth and ZigBee
   protocols. The first model is an IoT healthcare system that employs
   various sensors to collect heart rate and motion data. The second model
   is a home automation system that utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure
   temperature and humidity levels, a MQ2 sensor to detect gas leaks, and
   an ultrasonic sensor to control the garage door's opening and closing.
   Both systems are built around an Arduino or a Raspberry pi
   microcontrollers integrated with an Android mobile application to
   process and transmit data via Bluetooth or Zigbee ensuring that the
   mobile app receives real-time updates.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus
   (COVID-19) has caused the world to face an existential health crisis. To
   contain the infectious disease, many countries have quarantined their
   citizens for several weeks to months and even suspended most economic
   activities. To track the movements of residents, the governments of many
   states have adopted various novel technologies. Connecting billions of
   sensors and devices over the Internet, the so-called Internet of Things
   (IoT), has been used for outbreak control. However, these technologies
   also pose serious privacy risks and security concerns with regards to
   data transmission and storage. In this paper, we propose a
   blockchain-based system to provide the secure management of home
   quarantine. The privacy and security attributes for various events are
   based on advanced cryptographic primitives. To demonstrate the
   application of the system, we provide a case study in an IoT system with
   a desktop computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and the
   Ethereum smart contract platform. The obtained results prove its ability
   to satisfy security, efficiency, and low-cost requirements.},

Abstract = {The influence of Internet of Things (IoT) is growing exponentially in
   the consumer patterns and will continue to increase in the coming years.
   With millions of interconnected devices over the internet, IoT is
   currently running into its monumental security and centralization issues
   that can be resolved using Blockchain. This paper aims to demonstrate
   the use of a smart contract on a private Ethereum Blockchain (also known
   as permission less Blockchain) to check whether a user holds enough
   tokens to utilize a service. Private in this context implies a private
   instance of the Ethereum implementation in which we make use of the same
   security and principles of the Ethereum main chain on a personal network
   of connected IoT devices which improves the overall privacy and security
   of the system than the traditional schemes. The proposed model consists
   of a target IoT device controlled by a Raspberry Pi, running a client
   application that makes decisions based on the state of the smart
   contract. With this environment, we are able to achieve the following
   goals: (1) no data leaves the private network (2) all services are
   employed with transparency and accountability (3) only registered
   devices can issue requests for using a service. Although the
   demonstration is made on a home network, the model presented in this
   paper can be utilized in commercial environments where any service can
   be availed from a wide array of smart devices through a mobile
   application.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) changed the lifestyle of people around the
   globe with the invention of new gadgets and devices. With this motto an
   application is developed for the purpose of home which is called a
   virtual assistance and it also provides security to people by
   incorporating continuous surveillance in home. This made the home as
   smart and secure. In this paper a novel method is proposed and
   implemented that helps the people to getting the home status through IoT
   communication channels. A cost-effective stand-alone device for users to
   notify through surveillance module whenever a person interacts with the
   main door of the house. The system is working with a Raspberry Pi which
   is connecting with a Pi camera, a channel relay, a microphone
   connectivity and few speakers connected around the home. When a visitor
   interacts with the main door, the captured image is sent to the owner
   personal mobile via an e-mail which helps to notify the owner that
   someone is at the door. The visitor's image along with the date and

Abstract = {Smart Grid is a major element of the Smart City concept that enables
   two-way communication of energy data between electric utilities and
   their consumers. These communication technologies are going through
   sharp modernization to meet future demand growth and to achieve
   reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid. In this
   paper, we implement an IPv6 based two-way communication system between
   the transformer agent (TA), installed at local electric transformer and
   various customer agents (CAs), connected to customer's smart meter.
   Various homes share their energy usage with the TA which in turn sends
   the utility's recommendations to the CAs. Raspberry Pi is used as
   hardware for all the CAs and the TA. We implement a self-healing mesh
   network between all nodes using OpenLab IEEE 802.15.4 chips and Routing
   Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and the data is secured
   by RSA/AES keys. Several tests have been conducted in real environments,
   inside and outside of Carleton University, to test the performance of
   this communication network in various obstacle settings. In this paper,
   we highlight the details behind the implementation of this IPv6-based
   smart grid communication system, the related challenges, and the
   proposed solutions.},

Abstract = {Y A robust door lock system is the first and foremost thing to assure
   security to a home/building. Due to the ever-increasing responsibilities
   and daily tasks, people spend most of the time away from their homes. In
   such situations, identifying a visitor and getting remote access to
   their home is indispensable. A smart door lock which can be completely
   monitored and controlled from a remote location using an android
   application on a smartphone is proposed in this paper. When a visitor
   presses a calling bell/push button at the door, a Raspberry Pi with HD
   camera gets powered up and notifies the owner with a message and streams
   visitors' live identity on owner's mobile over the Internet. The owner,
   based on his willingness, can easily open/close the door remotely by
   entering a password that was preset. In addition, he can also convey an
   audio message to the visitor by entering the corresponding text in his
   smartphone app. The proof of concept provided in this paper emphasizes
   the real-time remote accessibility in the owner's hand (smartphone) on
   an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) over a cloud server.},

Abstract = {Wastage of electricity is one of the main problems which we are facing
   nowadays. In home and working areas, people will be engaged with too
   many activities. Sometimes, there might be a chance to forget to turn
   off various electrical appliances like lights, fans, servers, if there
   were nobody in the room or area/passage. This leads to huge power
   consumption. Also, it is very difficult to physically challenged persons
   and old-age people to access the appliances every time manually. To
   avoid all such situations, we proposed ``Smart Home System.{''} It is
   the process of automating home appliances in which the various electric
   and electronic appliances are wired up to a central computer control
   system so they can be handled more efficiently. ``Smart Home{''} helps
   to overcome the problems that usually people face in daily life. Behind
   this, it needs the involvement of multiple complex hardware components
   in controlling the smart home project and there is a fair amount of
   software architecture that is responsible for driving the hardware
   components. Moreover, there is a need to employ persons to monitor such
   simple tasks. This manual approach is time-consuming and also very
   costly. Thus, automation is the better alternative through which these
   tasks can be completed automatically without human effort and also
   accessed remotely from anywhere and anytime with less effort. Everyone
   is showing interest in making their home smarter to ease their daily
   activities. The proposed Smart Home system has the capability to control
   the home appliances based on the environment. Here, different boards
   like Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino UNO are going to be deployed which can
   take control over the appliances and act accordingly. People can also be
   notified, if there are any fire/gas leakages inside the home. This
   security system facilitates the user to take necessary actions as soon
   as possible to secure their home. It also involves the deployment of
   different kinds of sensors which can able to detect the object motion,
   temperature and humidity and fire detection. This application is very
   simple and can be implemented in all types of homes.},

Abstract = {Legacy-infrared (IR) devices are pervasively used. They are often
   controlled by IR remotes and cannot be controlled over the Internet. A
   trustworthy and cost-effective smart IR system that is able to change an
   IR controllable device into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) device and
   interconnect them for smart city/home applications is offered in this
   article. First, a printed circuit board (PCB) consisting of an IR
   receiver and multiple IR transmitters side by side which are capable of
   transmitting about 20 m indoors is designed and implemented. This IR
   transceiver board is the first of its kind. Second, the IR transceiver
   can be linked up with a Raspberry Pi, for which we develop two software
   tools, recording and replaying any IR signals so as to put the
   corresponding IR device in control. Third, a smartphone can be connected
   to the Pi by means of a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) cloud
   server so that the commands can be sent by the smartphone to the legacy
   IR device over the Internet. We have also identified the deficiency of
   TLS mutual authentication implemented by the popular MQTT open-source
   package Mosquitto for a trustworthy IoT system and patched the system.
   We analyze the factors that affect the IR signal transmission distance,
   discuss the security concerns of our IR transceiver, and illustrate the
   scenarios for attacks. For instance, TV can be turned off remotely by a
   drone equipped with the transceiver.},

Title = {Intelligent Optimization Mechanism Based on an Objective Function for
   Efficient Home Appliances Control in an Embedded Edge Platform},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {In recent years the ever-expanding internet of things (IoT) is becoming
   more empowered to revolutionize our world with the advent of
   cutting-edge features and intelligence in an IoT ecosystem. Thanks to
   the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to
   technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent
   occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous
   devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a
   comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the
   innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud
   computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based
   autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is
   challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a
   rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to
   provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a
   smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed
   a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to
   control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud
   computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality
   of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis,
   processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT
   sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing,
   storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of
   distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as
   microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through
   REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the
   functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption
   and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances.
   We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart
   home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application
   against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded
   edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the
   implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware
   of IoT devices.},

Abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been a great interest in the Internet
   of Things (IoT). This is mainly because the IoT interacts directly with
   people's everyday lives in critical applications, such as in smart homes
   and healthcare applications. IoT devices typically have a
   resource-constrained architecture, rendering them vulnerable to
   cyberattacks. Accordingly, smart devices and stored data need to be
   secured through lightweight and energy-efficient security solutions,
   which have been identified as the main challenge facing adoption of IoT
   systems. To address this problem, a disruptive technology (blockchain)
   has been foreseen by the industry and research community as being able
   to deliver secure, fast, reliable, and transparent solutions for IoT
   systems. Hence, this work investigates the adoption of lightweight
   blockchain technology, mainly as a method of securing IoT systems.
   Because hashing plays a major role in creating a robust blockchain
   structure, we select a number of different hash techniques to be
   executed on a Raspberry Pi device. In summation, this work provides a
   numerical study to evaluate the performance of well-known hash functions
   that can be used for lightweight blockchain-based IoT.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging technology and it plays a key role
   in developing smart cities. This new technology includes embedded
   devices, which are connected to the internet. IoT applications are
   spread over various fields like agriculture, healthcare, automotive
   industry, home automation, and security, etc. Nowadays, Wireless
   Communication (WC) is becoming an essential tool to link the devices,
   organizations, and people in the world. In IoT, WC is budding technology
   and more exploration is needed. This issue motivates the authors to
   propose generalized framework for WC in IoT. Framework is divided into
   five phases according to the architecture of IoT. First two phases focus
   on the configuration of sensors and gateways; third phase explains the
   cloud integration, fourth phase is about configuration of the server,
   and fifth phase considers the user interface. Hence, proposed framework
   does ease the work of IoT application developer. Authors illustrated the
   framework using the case study of electricity utilization in domestic.
   The application uses sensors and Raspberry pi for computing and
   providing electricity usage consumed by home or building using wireless
   communication between the devices. This provides the awareness to the
   user about power consumption pattern and better utilization of the
   electricity.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm which enables physical
   objects to operate over the Internet, and collect and share the data
   that describe the real physical world. In this ubiquitous environment,
   due to the heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security
   protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects,
   conventional authentication schemes may not meet the IoT security
   requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated.
   In this paper, a two-factor inter device mutual authentication scheme
   for smart home is proposed, where in the first level, the key exchange
   is performed using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and a public key
   cryptography in order to validate the identity of devices; and the
   second level relies on the use of infrared communication to distribute
   the One-Time Passwords (OTPs) among devices for authentication purpose.
   The HLPSL language is used to model the proposed protocol, and a
   security analysis is conducted using the SPAN (Security Protocol
   Animator for AVISPA (SPAN)/AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet
   Security Protocol and Applications) tool, showing that the proposed
   scheme can achieve the goals of secrecy of secret keys and mutual
   authentication. A proof-of-concept in the form of a hardware design is
   also proposed using Raspberry-Pi, Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC),
   Infrared circuit and a public-key-infrastructure. Experimentally, it is
   shown that this hardware design can achieve secure device-to-device
   authentication.},

Abstract = {Home automation and the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) have been
   existing for more than a decade, with billions of devices connected to
   the internet. The conventional home automation system allows users to
   control household appliances such as lights, air-conditioning,
   surveillance camera etc. via smartphone applications, webpages and
   control panels. One of the major drawbacks is with the operation
   efficiency, where people would still need their hands on the physical
   interfaces to access the system. It could be quite inconvenient for
   specific groups such as the elderly and disabled people, who will not
   benefit much from such systems. In light of this, the project proposes a
   methodology and design of a voice-controlled environment with emphasis
   on speech recognition and voice control based on Amazon Alexa and
   Raspberry Pi. In this implementation, office users can easily control
   their office appliances with voice commands, where as the model can be
   implemented for smart home users as well. The proposed voice-controlled
   implementation comprises eight main features: 1) Control of wired
   electrical appliances; 2) Control of Radio Frequency (RF) and Infrared
   (IR) appliances; 3) YouTube connected entertainment system; 4) Digital
   memo; 5) Face recognition attendance taking system with SQL database; 6)
   Security surveillance; 7) Room occupancy detection; 8) Telegram based
   voice-controlled text messaging. The proposed system not only saves time
   but also bring convenience to people.},

Title = {Imtidad: A Reference Architecture and a Case Study on Developing
   Distributed AI Services for Skin Disease Diagnosis over Cloud, Fog and

Abstract = {Several factors are motivating the development of preventive,
   personalized, connected, virtual, and ubiquitous healthcare services.
   These factors include declining public health, increase in chronic
   diseases, an ageing population, rising healthcare costs, the need to
   bring intelligence near the user for privacy, security, performance, and
   costs reasons, as well as COVID-19. Motivated by these drivers, this
   paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a reference architecture
   called Imtidad that provides Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) as
   a Service (DAIaaS) over cloud, fog, and edge using a service catalog
   case study containing 22 AI skin disease diagnosis services. These
   services belong to four service classes that are distinguished based on
   software platforms (containerized gRPC, gRPC, Android, and Android
   Nearby) and are executed on a range of hardware platforms (Google Cloud,
   HP Pavilion Laptop, NVIDIA Jetson nano, Raspberry Pi Model B, Samsung
   Galaxy S9, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4) and four network types (Fiber,
   Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth). The AI models for the diagnosis include
   two standard Deep Neural Networks and two Tiny AI deep models to enable
   their execution at the edge, trained and tested using 10,015 real-life
   dermatoscopic images. The services are evaluated using several
   benchmarks including model service value, response time, energy
   consumption, and network transfer time. A DL service on a local
   smartphone provides the best service in terms of both energy and speed,
   followed by a Raspberry Pi edge device and a laptop in fog. The services
   are designed to enable different use cases, such as patient diagnosis at
   home or sending diagnosis requests to travelling medical professionals
   through a fog device or cloud. This is the pioneering work that provides
   a reference architecture and such a detailed implementation and
   treatment of DAIaaS services, and is also expected to have an extensive
   impact on developing smart distributed service infrastructures for
   healthcare and other sectors.},

Abstract = {Home or Office Automation may be described as a system to provide ease
   of operation of connected devices or appliances. Most commercial
   environments, during active hours, consume large amounts of energy
   resources; this could be optimized to the minimum by smartly monitoring
   and managing the resources. IoT (Internet of Things) enables this to be
   a possible solution at reasonable cost factors. However, it is important
   to note that in commercial environments, security is a key factor;
   corporations cannot depend on opening up their networks to the outside
   world in order to avail the services offered by currently available
   smart-devices. Localizing and privatizing the entire automation and
   control system would be desirable for such domains. The work presented
   in this paper proposes a solution for such applications which is crucial
   for the development of Smart Cities as a whole along with Smart Homes.
   One of the simplest tasks is to switch a light source, HVAC systems or
   any other electrical equipment on or off, by being physically present in
   the premises, remotely or automatically based on time or a sensor's
   reading. Furthermore, the intensity of the light source, the temperature
   of the HVAC systems and such parameters could also be varied.
   Development of technology in the field has enabled the production of
   cheap and small-sized computers like Raspberry Pi which are also known
   as Single Board Computers (SBC). The prototype designed is equipped with
   a secure local MQTT link for communication between the control and
   automation system and the Edge Devices. Additionally, it is equipped
   with a speech recognition system to give the users a much more intuitive
   and natural mean to communicate with and control the connected devices.},

Title = {Internet of Things with Deep Learning-Based Face Recognition Approach
   for Authentication in Control Medical Systems},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) with deep learning (DL) is drastically growing
   and plays a significant role in many applications, including medical and
   healthcare systems. It can help users in this field get an advantage in
   terms of enhanced touchless authentication, especially in spreading
   infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even
   though there is a number of available security systems, they suffer from
   one or more of issues, such as identity fraud, loss of keys and
   passwords, or spreading diseases through touch authentication tools. To
   overcome these issues, IoT-based intelligent control medical
   authentication systems using DL models are proposed to enhance the
   security factor of medical and healthcare places effectively. This work
   applies IoT with DL models to recognize human faces for authentication
   in smart control medical systems. We use Raspberry Pi (RPi) because it
   has low cost and acts as the main controller in this system. The
   installation of a smart control system using general-purpose
   input/output (GPIO) pins of RPi also enhanced the antitheft for smart
   locks, and the RPi is connected to smart doors. For user authentication,
   a camera module is used to capture the face image and compare them with
   database images for getting access. The proposed approach performs face
   detection using the Haar cascade techniques, while for face recognition,
   the system comprises the following steps. The first step is the facial
   feature extraction step, which is done using the pretrained CNN models
   (ResNet-50 and VGG-16) along with linear binary pattern histogram (LBPH)
   algorithm. The second step is the classification step which can be done
   using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Only classified face as
   genuine leads to unlock the door; otherwise, the door is locked, and the
   system sends a notification email to the home/medical place with
   detected face images and stores the detected person name and time
   information on the SQL database. The comparative study of this work
   shows that the approach achieved 99.56\% accuracy compared with some
   different related methods.},

Title = {Low-cost intelligent surveillance system based on fast CNN},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Smart surveillance systems are used to monitor specific areas, such as
   homes, buildings, and borders, and these systems can effectively detect
   any threats. In this work, we investigate the design of low-cost
   multiunit surveillance systems that can control numerous surveillance
   cameras to track multiple objects (i.e., people, cars, and guns) and
   promptly detect human activity in real time using low computational
   systems, such as compact or single board computers. Deep learning
   techniques are employed to detect certain objects to surveil
   homes/buildings and recognize suspicious and vital events to ensure that
   the system can alarm officers of relevant events, such as stranger
   intrusions, the presence of guns, suspicious movements, and identified
   fugitives. The proposed model is tested on two computational systems,
   specifically, a single board computer (Raspberry Pi) with the Raspbian
   OS and a compact computer (Intel NUC) with the Windows OS. In both
   systems, we employ components, such as a camera to stream real-time
   video and an ultrasonic sensor to alarm personnel of threats when
   movement is detected in restricted areas or near walls. The system
   program is coded in Python, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is
   used to perform recognition. The program is optimized by using a
   foreground object detection algorithm to improve recognition in terms of
   both accuracy and speed. The saliency algorithm is used to slice certain
   required objects from scenes, such as humans, cars, and airplanes. In
   this regard, two saliency algorithms, based on local and global patch
   saliency detection are considered. We develop a system that combines two
   saliency approaches and recognizes the features extracted using these
   saliency techniques with a conventional neural network. The field
   results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection, ranging
   between 34\% and 99.9\% for different situations. The low percentage is
   related to the presence of unclear objects or activities that are
   different from those involving humans. However, even in the case of low
   accuracy, recognition and threat identification are performed with an
   accuracy of 100\% in approximately 0.7 s, even when using computer
   systems with relatively weak hardware specifications, such as a single
   board computer (Raspberry Pi). These results prove that the proposed
   system can be practically used to design a low-cost and intelligent
   security and tracking system.},

Abstract = {In today's world, where everyone wants to keep their valuables safe and
   secure, video surveillance for observing a particular area has become
   the need of the hour. To address this problem, we have come up with a
   solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank
   vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places,
   it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This
   wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the
   footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor.
   Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video
   cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and
   records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras
   will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information
   and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming
   is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs.
   Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is
   impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based
   background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background
   Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room
   where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send
   an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to
   identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and
   securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using
   blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security
   from hackers.},
