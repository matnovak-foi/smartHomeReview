	abstract = {Today, we are living in a technological world that it is necessary to use more advanced technologies to control devices remotely from different locations. Earlier electronic devices were controlled through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee in the restricted areas, but with the help of advanced technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud, we can extend it to such a level where we can control the devices even from remote areas. Raspberry Pi is one such technology which made a strong influence to control any electronic devices even from the remote areas. The technology designed can expand in allowing multiplicity of devices that can be controlled and also at a very low cost. Usage of Raspberry Pi device on home automation and its benefits need to be observed. Ever-growing connected ecosystem provisioned the industry to change the way we interact with the traditional brick and mortar houses to such an extent that the user is entirely in control of his home’s comfort and security. For the useful utilization of power very effectively, certain human errors happening unintentionally need to be reduced, like to switch off home appliances; the home automation system has to be designed in such a way that they need to control all electronic devices of a house remotely in a secured and safe manner. The smart home is one of the most mainstream applications which can improve the inhabitant’s life quality. Nevertheless, the security and protection problems of the house owner bring developing difficulties, while an ever-increasing number of information are gathered and shared by the various IoT gadgets inside the smart home. Blockchain for an IoT is a developing enchanting innovation strategy that gives a private, secure, and decentralized instrument for the information utilization in smart home. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Nowadays home automation is used increasingly with the help of Smartly controlling home devices. With the plenty of manufacturers and the latest technologies, the usage of home automation is up to the mark. Firstly, from a social point of view, human care is very essential for physically challenged and elderly people. Secondly, it is implemented using a single Raspberry Pi controller. The controller controls and monitors many home appliances that are interconnected to form a home network. For example, the home appliances such as lights, Fans, temperature and humidity sensors, gas leakage detectors, smoke detectors, and fire detectors can be controlled by a single controller. It also includes the establishment of security and emergency alert systems in case of an emergency. So, this leads to an idea to develop a smart home controlling system for physically challenged people. The system developed must be low cost, low power consumption, cheaper, cost-effective, flexible and it should be user-friendly interface, same as the usage of the remote control of various electronic gadgets in our day-to-day life. It should be designed as user-friendly, so that the person can use it very easily and effectively same as, other hand-held devices. In this paper, a smartly controlling system was developed especially for physically challenged and elderly people. This was done by integrating Raspberry Pi and various sensors into the web applications. To design this system, a Raspberry Pi module along with a voice control technique is used. The output of this system is to control home appliances. All the home appliances are simply controlled by connecting through a monitor built on the internet. Raspberry Pi is used to operate and controls the motion sensors and voice recognition for controlling the home appliance through human voice to provide the smart home. It is a very simple technique that was very much helpful to helpless people.  © 2022 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Smart home applications are ubiquitous and have gained popularity due to the over-whelming use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technology. The revolution in technologies has made homes more convenient, efficient, and even more secure. The need for advancement in smart home technology is necessary due to the scarcity of intelligent home applications that cater to several aspects of the home simultaneously, i.e., automation, security, safety, and reducing energy consump-tion using less bandwidth, computation, and cost. Our research work provides a solution to these problems by deploying a smart home automation system with the applications mentioned above over a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi (RPI) device. The RPI is used as a central controlling unit, which provides a cost-effective platform for interconnecting a variety of devices and various sensors in a home via the Internet. We propose a cost-effective integrated system for smart home based on IoT and Edge-Computing paradigm. The proposed system provides remote and automatic control to home appliances, ensuring security and safety. Additionally, the proposed solution uses the edge-computing paradigm to store sensitive data in a local cloud to preserve the customer’s privacy. Moreover, visual and scalar sensor-generated data are processed and held over edge device (RPI) to reduce bandwidth, computation, and storage cost. In the comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed system is 5% faster in detecting motion, and 5 ms and 4 ms in switching relay on and off, respectively. It is also 6% more efficient than the existing solutions with respect to energy consumption. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The popularity and demand of home automation has increased exponentially in recent years because of the ease it provides. Recently, development has been done in this domain and few systems have been proposed that either use voice assistants or application for controlling the electrical appliances. However; less emphasis is laid on power efficiency and this system cannot be integrated with the existing appliances and hence, the entire system needs to be upgraded adding to a lot of additional cost in purchasing new appliances. In this research, the objective is to design such a system that emphasises on power efficiency as well as can be integrated with the already existing appliances. NodeMCU, along with Raspberry Pi, Firebase realtime database, is used to create a system that accomplishes such endeavours and can control relays, which can control these appliances without the need of replacing them. The experiments in this paper demonstrate triggering of electrical appliances using voice assistant, fire alarm on the basis of flame sensor and temperature sensor. Moreover; use of android application was presented for operating electrical appliances from a remote location. Lastly, the system can be modified by adding security cameras, smart blinds, robot vacuums etc. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Several factors are motivating the development of preventive, personalized, connected, virtual, and ubiquitous healthcare services. These factors include declining public health, increase in chronic diseases, an ageing population, rising healthcare costs, the need to bring intelligence near the user for privacy, security, performance, and costs reasons, as well as COVID-19. Motivated by these drivers, this paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a reference architecture called Imtidad that provides Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a Service (DAIaaS) over cloud, fog, and edge using a service catalog case study containing 22 AI skin disease diagnosis services. These services belong to four service classes that are distinguished based on software platforms (containerized gRPC, gRPC, Android, and Android Nearby) and are executed on a range of hardware platforms (Google Cloud, HP Pavilion Laptop, NVIDIA Jetson nano, Raspberry Pi Model B, Samsung Galaxy S9, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4) and four network types (Fiber, Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth). The AI models for the diagnosis include two standard Deep Neural Networks and two Tiny AI deep models to enable their execution at the edge, trained and tested using 10,015 real-life dermatoscopic images. The services are evaluated using several benchmarks including model service value, response time, energy consumption, and network transfer time. A DL service on a local smartphone provides the best service in terms of both energy and speed, followed by a Raspberry Pi edge device and a laptop in fog. The services are designed to enable different use cases, such as patient diagnosis at home or sending diagnosis requests to travelling medical professionals through a fog device or cloud. This is the pioneering work that provides a reference architecture and such a detailed implementation and treatment of DAIaaS services, and is also expected to have an extensive impact on developing smart distributed service infrastructures for healthcare and other sectors. © 2022 by the authors.

The study developed a surveillance system using Raspberry Pi and camera to detect and recognize a door caller’s face from a live video stream and compare with an existing dataset to verify whether the person was authorized. If not authorized, the remote homeowner can be alerted via an email complete with an image of the caller. Automated and user actions can be performed depending on the type of visitor. RaspController, Google Assistant and VNC were used for actuation, to perform actions like playing random music, triggering voice conversations or turning on an alarm. The recognition system was developed in Python using OpenCV and face recognition, using pre trained models for Hog detection and Haar Cascade classification. The accuracy of the detection was 66.7% for a small cohort of seven authorized people and an unauthorized class of five people. For actuation, interoperability with many smart home devices can be controlled from the smart home network, but with only limited functionality from a remote network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Resource constrained devices face serious issues to run complex cryptographic algorithms. Trying to evaluate the performance impact of those algorithms in usual and common devices used in smart homes, in this paper we tested the impact of different cryptographic algorithms in low computational devices, typically used in smart devices applied in smart homes, testing different security configurations and using the two most used transport protocols (HTTP and MQTT). The experiment measures their effects on six commonly used embedded devices in IoT WSNs: ESP8622, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi (RPi) from 1 to 4. The experiment measured the power consumption, message delay, and additional message length (bytes). Moreover, the analysis was also used to model security algorithms. The experimental results from long runs (72 hours) reveal the cryptographic solution choice is significant for the message delay and additional message length. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The visually impaired users rely heavily on these IoT devices and assistive technologies for guidance, medical usage, mobility help, voice recognition, news feeds and emergency communications. However, cyber attackers are deploying Evil Twin and Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, among others, to penetrate the network, establish rogue Wi-Fi access points and trick victims into connecting to it, leading to interceptions, manipulation, exploitation, compromising the smart devices and taking command and control. The paper aims to explore the Evil Twin attack on smart devices and provide mitigating techniques to improve privacy and trust. The novelty contribution of the paper is three-fold: First, we identify the various IoT device vulnerabilities and attacks. We consider the state-of-the-art IoT cyberattacks on Smart TVs, Smart Door Lock, and cameras. Secondly, we created a virtual environment using Kali Linux (Raspberry Pi) and NetGear r7000 as the home router for our testbed. We deployed an Evil Twin attack to penetrate the network to identify the vulnerable spots on the IoT devices. We consider the Kill Chain attack approach for the attack pattern. Finally, we recommend a security mechanism in a table to improve security, privacy and trust. Our results show how vulnerabilities in smart home appliances are susceptible to attacks. We have recommended mitigation techniques to enhance the security for visually impaired users.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has assumed a pivotal role in the advancement of communication technology and in our daily lives. However, an IoT system such as a smart grid with poorly designed topology and weak security protocols might be vulnerable to cybercrimes. Exploits may arise from sensor data interception en route to the intended consumer within an IoT system. The increasing integration of electronic devices interconnected via the internet has galvanized the acceptance of this technology. Nonetheless, as the number of users of this technology surges, there must be an aligned concern to ensure that security measures are diligently enforced within IoT communication systems, such as in smart homes, smart cities, smart factories, smart hospitals, and smart grids. This research addresses security lacunae in the topology and configuration of IoT energy monitoring systems using post-quantum cryptographic techniques. We propose tailored implementations of the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), N-th degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRU), and a suite of cryptographic primitives based on Module Learning With Rounding (Saber) as post-quantum cryptographic candidate algorithms for IoT devices. These aim to secure publisher–subscriber end-to-end communication in energy system monitoring. Additionally, we offer a comparative analysis of these tailored implementations on low-resource devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, during data transmission using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Results indicate that the customized implementation of NTRU outperforms both SABER and RSA in terms of CPU and memory usage, while Light SABER emerges as the front-runner when considering encryption and decryption delays. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Ongoing ransomware attacks have forced business to think about security of their resources. Recently, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) have become easy targets for attackers since they don’t have cyber defense mechanism in place other than simple firewall systems which are quite vulnerable. Cyber defense systems are costly and often not within the budget of SMEs which inspired to think about low cost yet highly efficient cyber defense solutions. This research explores the prospects of implementing a Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi)-based intelligent cyber-defense system (iCDS) for SME networks and Smart-homes to filter malicious contents from incoming traffic. Primarily, the work presented in this paper tries to evaluate the hardware capability of network interfaces (both internal, and attached) of Raspberry Pi for handle high volumes of incoming traffic. For this, we measure the network performance of the Raspberry Pi using the speed test software. The results show that the built in Ethernet interface outperforms the built in WiFi and external attached USB to Ethernet Adapter in terms of latency, download and upload throughput. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Public places like institutions, organisations, banks, parks, etc or even homes need to be guarded to prevent theft or an attack. It is impossible for a single guard to man all the probable locations of intrusions at the same time for 24 hours and adding multiple guards will increase operational costs thereby adding financial burden on institutions. CCTVs are a static mode of surveillance as they are immovable and it needs multiple devices to be set up to completely cover an area. We aim to provide a solution by developing an IoT based Smart Surveillance System. This system consists of a robot with wheels attached which makes it mobile in nature and has an ultrasonic sensor mounted for object detection and the components are controlled by Arduino UNO. Also the robot has a camera mounted on top for Face Detection and the camera is controlled by Raspberry Pi. The system displays a live video feed and also notifies the user if a face is detected on the video feed, by raising an alarm and also on registered email along with the last captured frame. Thus, our system will help in safeguarding important places with minimal effort and will provide timely updates.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The android application has been developed using the Python programming language on the server side and Java is being used to develop the application on the client side. The system notifies the user about any possible theft or intrusion in one’s environment by clicking pictures and recording a video for a period using a proprietary Raspberry Pi camera and storing it into the MySQL database in the Raspberry Pi itself.

Implementing an The IoT-based smart home has attracted a great deal of attention has developed into an important area of study in the modern day. 'Home automation' refers to the automatic and computerised control of appliances, activities, and aspects of the home. Simply said, it means you may easily manage the utilities and operations of your home over the Internet, simplifying and securing daily tasks while also reducing household expenses. The smart home idea improves the comfort and convenience of our lives with the help of IoT. The two key issues in the current smart home environment are automation and security. Sensors that can keep an eye on variations in the amount of daylight, the temperature, or motion detection can be used. These (and other) parameters may then be customised by home automation systems to suit your preferences. In this paper, the above problem is investigated using hardware that is simple, inexpensive, and easily available. Despite the hardware's modest cost, its capabilities should not be overlooked. This system can be incredibly powerful and secure if the correct tools are used. In this paper, the viability of such a setup is assessed for everyday usage and was found to be quite effective.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Even with the right involvement of manpower, it is difficult to identify unusual events like fire accidents, gas leakage, and motion or presence of an intruder. The Internet of Things is a technology in which all devices communicate with each other through the internet. This technology can be used in our home security systems in an effective manner. Many existing systems failed to meet some challenging issues like multi-sensing operations, delay in alerts and non-continuous monitoring due to power breakdowns. In this paper, we developed an IoT-based smart security alert system which is used to send alerts to the owner through SMS and email whenever there is an intruder or other harmful activities are taking place at the home. This system mainly consists of Raspberry Pi-3, Pi camera, power shifting circuit, gas sensor, fire sensor, IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, GSM module, Buzzer and mobile. In the proposed system, whenever any intruder is detected the system will capture an image and alert the user by sending SMS and email to the user. It also provides security regarding fire and smoke by sending SMS to the user. Our proposed system is also equipped with a power shifter circuit which provides continuous supply to the circuit for continuous monitoring. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.},

It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-Automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others. The main purpose of our paper is to build a perfect smart home-helper for the users to operate the home appliances easily through voice commands. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Home automation and video surveillance systems are constantly undergoing changes due to advances in electronics and communications. Starting with telephone-controlled home appliances and a simple camera-based system, home automation and video surveillance have now entered the IoT (Internet of Things) and IoE (Internet of Everything) era, where every device integrated smart are connected to worldwide network and controlled abroad. Home automation makes life easier by providing control of all home appliances at one point, which is basically by a smartphone. The need for surveillance is rapidly increasing in domestic and commercial applications due to its low cost and ease of deployment. To ensure the security of video surveillance of personal homes and small businesses, people resort to third-party organizations with expensive equipment. In turn, the solution for providing a video surveillance security system based on a Rasp berry Pi single-board computer using HomeAssistant software is more profitable and easier to implement. The choice fell on the HomeAssistant software, since HomeAssistant is an open source application and does not require additional costs. This article analyzes how home automation and video surveillance systems have been modified and implemented. For the review, the Home Assistant smart home platform was implemented with the introduction of a video surveillance system.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) remote control is a widely used technology at home due to its simplicity and low cost. Most considered it to be "secure" because of the line-of-sight usage within the home. In this paper, we revisit the security of IR remote control schemes and examine their security assumptions under the settings of internet-connected smart homes. We focus on two specific questions: (1) whether IR signals could be sniffed by an IoT device; and (2) what information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals. To answer these questions, we design a sniff module using a commercial-off-the-shelf IR receiver on a Raspberry Pi and show that the Infrared (IR) signal emanating from the remote control of a Smart TV can be captured by one of the nearby IoT devices, for example, a smart air-conditioner, even the signal is not aimed at the air-conditioner. The IR signal range and receiving angle are larger than most have thought. We also developed algorithms to extract semantic information from the sniffed IR control signals, and evaluated with realworld applications. The results showed that lots of sensitive information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals, including account name and password, PIN code, and even payment information. © USENIX Security 2023.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that involves connecting the virtual world of the Internet to the real world through so-called smart objects. Indeed, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively employed in a wide range of applications, including healthcare field and home automation. These objects are equipped with communication capabilities and can exchange data over the Internet. In recent times, the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge of growth and transformation. The integration of IoT-enabled devices has revolutionized remote monitoring in healthcare, empowering healthcare providers to keep their patients safe and healthy while delivering exceptional care. On the other hand, the home automation system is becoming increasingly popular due to its many benefits, which involve remotely monitoring and controlling household appliances. In fact, the main challenges faced by home automation systems are poor manageability, rigidity, difficulty in achieving security, and high ownership costs. As the internet and its applications continue to grow, there is enormous potential for remotely accessing, controlling and monitoring network-enabled devices. With this context in mind, the objective of this project is to develop two IoT-based models. These models are based on Arduino and Raspberry pi boards, cloud, Bluetooth and ZigBee protocols. The first model is an IoT healthcare system that employs various sensors to collect heart rate and motion data. The second model is a home automation system that utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels, a MQ2 sensor to detect gas leaks, and an ultrasonic sensor to control the garage door's opening and closing. Both systems are built around an Arduino or a Raspberry pi microcontrollers integrated with an Android mobile application to process and transmit data via Bluetooth or Zigbee ensuring that the mobile app receives real-time updates. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The local binary pattern histogram (LBPH), eigenface and fisherface algorithms are considered for evaluation. The evaluation analyzes the accuracy of a model in detecting human faces, its computation time and vulnerability to photo hacking while implemented in Raspberry pi platform. It covers a large number of stored faces and the cases of variation in angle and illumination in the face image.

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems related to the operation of smart microgrids is the optimal home energy management scheme with multiple and conflicting objectives. Moreover, there is a noticeable increase in homes equipped with renewable energy sources (RESs), where the coordination of loads and generation can achieve extra savings and minimize peak loads. In this paper, a solar-powered smart home with optimal energy management is designed in an affordable and secure manner, allowing the owner to control the home from remote and local sites using their smartphones and PCs. The Raspberry Pi 4 B is used as the brain of the proposed smart home automation management system (HAMS). It is used to collect the data from the existing sensors and store them, and then take the decision. The home is monitored using a graphical interface that monitors room temperature, humidity, smoke, and lighting through a set of sensors, as well as PIR sensors to monitor the people movement. This action enables remote control of all home appliances in a safe and emission-free manner. This target is reached using Cayenne, which is an IoT platform, in addition to building some codes related to some appliances and sensors not supported in Cayenne from scratch. Convenience for people with disabilities is considered by using the Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa) to control home appliances and the charging point by voice, implementing the associated code for connecting the Raspberry pi with Alexa from scratch, and simulating the system on LabVIEW. To reach the optimal operation and reduce the operating costs, an optimization framework for the home energy management system (HEMS) is proposed. The operating costs for the day amounted to approximately 16.039 €. There is a decrease in the operating costs by about 23.13%. The consumption decreased after using the smart HAMS by 18.161 kWh. The results of the optimization also show that the least area that can be used to install solar panels to produce the desired energy with the lowest cost is about 118.1039 m2, which is about 23.62% of the total surface area of the home in which the study was conducted. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of automation, security, safety, and low operating costs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the growing concept of smart cities, IoT applications such as face-authenticated smart-home door-lock security systems have gained importance and become popular. The major challenge in implementing the algorithms on IoT devices is a lack of computational power. The major challenge in implementing the algorithms on IoT devices is a lack of computational power. The state-of-the-art methods run successfully in high-end computing units, are typically not used in Raspberry pi, considered as an IoT device. This paper aims to design an authorized door lock system using the framework Raspberry pi. Instead of Euclidean distance-based similarity measure between the test and the trained face images, here for face identification the pretrained FACENET model is used that reduces the false cases. In the current approach, Haar-Cascade is used to detect the faces and next we train the fully connected layers on the collected facial embeddings of FACENET. The proposed Haar-Cascade FACENET Fully Connected Face Authentication (HFFCFA) model eliminates the faults which occur in the Euclidean-based approach, thus reducing false positive and false negative cases. The network model works perfectly together with the Raspberry Pi pipeline for face recognition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {This work is dedicated to the Smart Office and Smart Home design: a brief smart survey of the used protocols, platforms, and best practices under consideration of the following criteria like price factor, easy configuring and manageability, data security, and privacy aspects, as well as energy efficiency. The practical problems for IoT and IIoT components compatibility as well as cloud independence, are discussed too. The authors mostly favor open-source and cloud-free solutions for Smart Home and established commercial platforms for Smart Office with advanced security, as shown in the presented case studies. Blockchaining of IoT and IIoT contributes to the compulsoriness and commitment in the decentralized world of “smart things” at home and in office rooms. However, secured smart devices can only be achieved with the combination of known crypto-technologies. Through a step-by-step provision of different blockchain-based platforms, the declared protection goals can be reached. The main features of the functioning of IoT, Edge, and Cloud computing technologies are considered. An intelligent IoT system has been developed to collect data from a specific location and transmit it to an Edge device for on-site processing. This data will be transferred to the cloud system or further processing or remote management, if needed. The solution aims to reduce the cost of maintaining the system by reducing the volume of messages that are sent to the cloud platform, which is quite expensive and a weighty factor in using the system, to provide remote management without buying a fixed server part. An algorithm for predicting temperature values in the server room of a smart office has been proposed and implemented in a designed IoT system based on Raspberry Pi 4 using an LSTM model. Using this solution in practice will increase the reliability of server equipment by early prediction, warning, and taking measures in case of temperature rise. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Hackers exploit vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and insecure, unencrypted data transfer to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Sensible deployment of conventional security measures is jeopardized by the heterogeneity and resource constraints of smart devices. This article presents a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to detect anomalous behavior in smart home environments. We prototype a smart camera using Raspberry Pi and gather power traces for normal activity. Furthermore, we model DDoS attacks on the experimental setup and generate attack traces of power consumption. Besides, we compare the performances of several machine learning models for accurate prediction of the presence of anomalies. A deep feed-forward neural network model achieves an accuracy of 99.2% compared to other models. Empirical evaluations of the proposed concept affirm that power consumption is a promising parameter in detecting anomalies in smart homes. The proposed method is suitable for smart homes as it does not impose additional overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

With millions of interconnected devices over the internet, IoT is currently running into its monumental security and centralization issues that can be resolved using Blockchain. This paper aims to demonstrate the use of a smart contract on a private Ethereum Blockchain (also known as permission less Blockchain) to check whether a user holds enough tokens to utilize a service. Private in this context implies a private instance of the Ethereum implementation in which we make use of the same security and principles of the Ethereum main chain on a personal network of connected IoT devices which improves the overall privacy and security of the system than the traditional schemes. The proposed model consists of a target IoT device controlled by a Raspberry Pi, running a client application that makes decisions based on the state of the smart contract. With this environment, we are able to achieve the following goals: (1) no data leaves the private network (2) all services are employed with transparency and accountability (3) only registered devices can issue requests for using a service. Although the demonstration is made on a home network, the model presented in this paper can be utilized in commercial environments where any service can be availed from a wide array of smart devices through a mobile application. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

Owing to the numerous benefits brought about by smart homes, research on the topic has been increasing at an exponential rate, bringing quality properties such as security, usability, reliability, and others. Despite their various advantages, smart homes have not been in a positive spotlight regarding security and reliability. The main reason that people are hesitant towards adopting an implemented intelligent system at their domicile is due to the lack of trust they allocate to the electronics. As such, this paper provides insights on an innovative and low-cost smart home monitoring system named RaspiMonitor. While the central aim of the system is to offer a robust smart home architecture which discreetly caters for the safety and security of its environment, it also helps in reducing energy wastage. The RaspiMonitor was carefully designed using dynamic web-based services in addition to an evaluation which quantified its usability and acceptance through the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with 6 constructs. Results in principle portray acceptance of the system with a mean score of 4.47. This indicates that a robust hardware and software architecture such as the RaspiMonitor is useful, convenient, and easy to use. © 2022 IEEE.},

However, many of the connected devices particularly in smart homes are the target of attacks that try to exploit security vulnerabilities such as hard-coded passwords and insecure data transfer. Recent studies show that there is a considerable surge in the number of phishing attacks targeting smart homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many of the existing user authentication protocols in the literature incur additional computational overhead and need to be made more resilient to smart home targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight and privacy-preserving remote user authentication protocol for securing smart home applications. Our approach is based on Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) to make our protocol resilient to smart home attacks such as smartphone capture attacks and phishing attacks. In addition, the lightweight nature of our solution is suitable for deployment on heterogeneous and resource constrained IoT devices. Besides, we leverage geometric secret sharing for establishing mutual authentication among the participating entities. We validate the security of the proposed protocol using the AVISPA formal verification tool and prototype it on a Raspberry Pi to analyze the power consumption. Finally, a comparison with existing schemes reveals that our scheme incurs a 20% reduction in communication overhead on smart devices. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is usable as it absolves users from memorizing passwords and carrying smart cards.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The IoT applications can be found in various fields of our life, such as smart home, health care, smart building, and etc. In all these applications, the data collected from the real world are transmitted through the Internet; therefore, these data have become a target of many attacks and hackers. Hence, a secure communication must be provided to protect the transmitted data from unauthorized access. This paper focuses on designing a secure IoT system to protect the sensing data. In this system, the security is provided by the use of Lightweight AES encryption algorithm to encrypt the data received from physical environment. The hardware used in this proposal is the Raspberry Pi 3 model B and two types of sensors. The LAES algorithm was embedded inside the Raspberry in order to protect the sensing data, that come from sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi, before sending them through the network. The analysis results show that the proposed IoT security system consumes less time in encryption/decryption and has high throughput when compared with others from related work. Its throughput is higher in about 19.24% than the value reported for one system in the related studies. © 2021 University of Baghdad-College of Science. All rights reserved.},

It is used to restrict access to a system, application, or service to only those users who have the authorization to use the system or device. Because of increased computing power, modern passwords must be very long and complicated, which will make them hard to remember. Some research studies show that it is easier for people to remember visual passwords instead of textual ones. Therefore, this research aims to enhance the authentication process's security using the graphical pattern unlock approach on Raspberry Pi. The grid size of 5 × 5 was selected in the implementation, as it provides the tradeoff between security strength and an easy pattern to remember. The proposed system could be connected to the smart home system, which can enhance their security.

	abstract = {Nowadays, the care of elderly peoples is a significant problem and needs more time and attention from the caregivers. In the elderly population, accidental fall is a common cause of injury due to the weakness or any other disease such as high temperature and blood pressure. Moreover, in developing countries, the use of natural gas for older adults is widespread for room heating. The use of a gas heater in a room can be hazardous, especially at night and it has reportedly said to turn OFF the gas heater while going to sleep. However, it is ignored quite often that results in many deaths not only to the elderly but to all age groups. To cope with these issues and to provide a safer environment, especially to the older people where the caretaker can be informed well on-time, a raspberry Pi assisted cost-effective safety system is proposed. The 3-axis accelerometer of gas and flame sensors are used to detect an event when accidental fall occurs precisely, or any gas leakage or flame is detected. The caretaker will be informed using a mobile app or text alert to take action immediately. Results demonstrate that the modules for fall and gas/open flame detection accurately detected true events by 92% and 95% respectively. The primary purpose of the proposed system is to provide a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient method for the safety of the elderly population.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The market for Domotics, most commonly known as Home Automation, has exponentially grown in the past few years. In brief, Domotics allows users to monitor and control various devices/appliances within a smart home. From entertainment to security, several devices have become more accessible. However, the underlying network infrastructure in this environment has remained the same despite the recent revolution brought about by Software-Defined Networking (SDN).For the past decade, SDN has shown great potential for providing more network flexibility and programmability in both the control and data plane. However, most of the use cases are thought for enterprise and Data-Center Networks, while its application closer to the end-users (i.e., Home environments) is still under-exploited. Therefore, this research introduces the Network Operations for Domotics (NeO-Domotics) notion, which uses Next-Generation SDN components (e.g., P4, NG-SDN interfaces) in the context of Home Automation. This paper describes the overall design and showcases preliminary use cases using a Raspberry Pi.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is now a critical component of home automation and security, particularly for door lock systems. Face recognition powered by IoT is becoming more popular because it is dependable and simple to use. To prevent algorithmic errors and produce enhanced accuracy than existing systems, our system employs a facial recognition door lock with the integration of three algorithms on a single camera. The system detects unauthorized people near the entrance and notifies the user via a mobile app. For hardware communication, we used a camera module, a Raspberry PI, passive infrared motion sensors, and wireless internet access. The Python and OpenCV libraries are used in the algorithm's development. When the motion sensor detects activity in front of the door, the camera is activated, and the system gathers camera feeds and sends the images to three algorithms for analysis. If any two or all of the algorithm's results match the image in the database, the door unlocks; otherwise, it remains locked. The development of this system aims to enhance accuracy by combining three algorithms and to provide consumers with data about what is happening in front of their home via a smart door lock system. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Empirical studies suggest that environment is the main factor influencing crime patterns so that closed circuit television (CCTV) becomes the choice to reduce the risk of crime. However, CCTV is less effective because it requires high bandwidth & storage and cannot provide notifications. Therefore, a technology called the Internet of Things (IoT) appears so that CCTV or webcam can work together with sensors to detect the presence of intruders and provide notifications. This study proposes a system that detects intruders and sends notifications to homeowner regardless of time and place. This system is usually referred to as a smart home security system. The authors proposed the smart home security system for intruder detection using YOLO V3 algorithm. This research is implemented using magnetic door sensor and alarm or buzzer and a webcam connected to Raspberry Pi 3B+. This proposed system will send notifications using telegram.

The traditional security such as Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras are very easy to break and lead to theft. And moreover, the installation cost of the security systems is costlier. To overcome these problems, we are presenting Internet of Things (IoT) based solution where we can setup a smart security system. In this paper, we are proposing the system with the help of face detection and face recognition algorithms to secure our home which gives us the facility of entire surveillance of our buildings remotely and take appropriate action if anything goes wrong. The Camera Serial Interface (CSI) is attached to the Raspberry PI which detects presence of person using Face detection and recognition algorithms. The multiple Raspberry PIs attached in different areas of our buildings are connected to the main Raspberry PI which acts as hub module. If the person is identified as unknown, the information is sent to Hub module which in turn sends the alert message and live video streaming to the user using an app which we developed.  © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

In voice password and biometric based authentication door locking system, authentication using the unique identification like biometric and voice recognition plays a vital role to provide high level of security. The finger ridges of individual do not match with any other finger ridges and an individual's voice cannot be impersonated with accuracy.This paper proposes a smart voice password and biometric based security system for door locking in smart homes. To enhance the security, in place of conventional door locking system, a finger print sensor along with a micro phone are used to authenticate, i.e. to lock and unlock the doors [1]. The data base will maintain the data of the persons who tried to access the door. The entire system is controlled by the Raspberry pi 3 B+ processor. PIWHO soft ware is used for the purpose of voice recognition. Door access may be provided to the registered users based on his voice pass word and thumb impression. Door will be opened only when both the factors are satisfied, otherwise buzzer will be activated and the authorized person will receive an SMS alert message.  © 2021 IEEE.},

To contain the infectious disease, many countries have quarantined their citizens for several weeks to months and even suspended most economic activities. To track the movements of residents, the governments of many states have adopted various novel technologies. Connecting billions of sensors and devices over the Internet, the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), has been used for outbreak control. However, these technologies also pose serious privacy risks and security concerns with regards to data transmission and storage. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system to provide the secure management of home quarantine. The privacy and security attributes for various events are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. To demonstrate the application of the system, we provide a case study in an IoT system with a desktop computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and the Ethereum smart contract platform. The obtained results prove its ability to satisfy security, efficiency, and low-cost requirements. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The advent of smart homes has revolutionized residential living, integrating advanced technologies and intelligent devices to create secure, comfortable, and efficient environments. However, this integration of diverse smart devices has brought significant cybersecurity challenges. Detecting and analyzing abnormal network packets have become paramount, signifying potential intrusions, malicious activities, or system errors and ensuring the security and stability of smart home systems. Machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Random Forests, have shown promise in addressing these challenges. However, most research has concentrated on anomaly detection rather than malicious activity in smart homes. The vast datasets collected from various scenarios pose methodological and algorithmic challenges for applying machine learning techniques. To fill these research gaps, our study introduces traditional machine-learning methods for detecting abnormal network packets in smart homes using the IoT-23 dataset. It involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features, and training various machine learning models. The correlation matrix helps validate the feature selection of the best models based on performance metrics like precision, F1-score, recall, accuracy ratio, training score, and training time cost. Additionally, the study classifies 12 types of malicious malware across different machine learning models, considering performance within the context of smart home devices. This study implements real-time anomaly detection on the Raspberry Pi using packet captures and Zeek flowmeter methods. The findings contribute insights into models suitable for smart home security. In addition, our research enhances the understanding and application of machine learning methods for bolstering security in smart homes.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been a great interest in the Internet of Things (IoT). This is mainly because the IoT interacts directly with people's everyday lives in critical applications, such as in smart homes and healthcare applications. IoT devices typically have a resource-constrained architecture, rendering them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Accordingly, smart devices and stored data need to be secured through lightweight and energy-efficient security solutions, which have been identified as the main challenge facing adoption of IoT systems. To address this problem, a disruptive technology (blockchain) has been foreseen by the industry and research community as being able to deliver secure, fast, reliable, and transparent solutions for IoT systems. Hence, this work investigates the adoption of lightweight blockchain technology, mainly as a method of securing IoT systems. Because hashing plays a major role in creating a robust blockchain structure, we select a number of different hash techniques to be executed on a Raspberry Pi device. In summation, this work provides a numerical study to evaluate the performance of well-known hash functions that can be used for lightweight blockchain-based IoT. © 2021 The Authors},

The primary goal of Home automation is to provide pleasant, secure, efficient, and easy management or monitoring of home appliances, using sensors that save energy too. For controlling the home appliances, existing systems use Bluetooth, Zigbee, GSM Module, WLAN, or Internet Technology. Home automation systems have been further enhanced using Arduino, Node MCU, Raspberry Pi, and WIFI Module. When billions of devices are online and this data-rich world enabled by the Internet of things is fully operational, cloud computing won't be able to handle the workload. Every IoT sensor produces a significant amount of data. Data is promptly transferred to a central cloud database in cloud computing, where it is managed and stored. But occasionally, a response may be interrupted or delayed owing to a network error or a poor internet connection simply because the data centre is too far away from the device. This problem is solved by the use of edge computing, IoT device itself or the nearby node network is behind the data processing and can response in an exact manner if a specific action is needed. In the proposed paper a detailed review conducted regarding existing technologies and existing home automation system (HAS). With the same reference to IoT, new architecture needs to be developed and providing data security using the edge computing instead of Cloud Computing. © 2022 ACM.},

This research studies and focuses on the security threats in smart home networks by using Raspberry Pi which is low cost and portable. Our system, which is called PITI, performs hybrid detection by combining Snort IDS and behavior-based profile analysis together in order to efficiently detect malicious and suspicious traffic. The current version of PITI can alert anomaly traffic by showing a message on the screen and also alert by sounds. For the future work, PITI device should be developed into Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which can drop the suspicious packets and detect more type of attacks.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Face recognition system is broadly used for human identification because of its capacity to measure the facial points and recognize the identity in an unobtrusive way. The application of face recognition systems can be applied to surveillance at home, workplaces, and campuses, accordingly. The problem with existing face recognition systems is that they either rely on the facial key points and landmarks or the face embeddings from FaceNet for the recognition process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical network (HN) framework which uses pre-trained architecture for recognizing faces followed by the validation from face embeddings using FaceNet. We also designed a real-time face recognition security door lock system connected with raspberry pi as an implication of the proposed method. The evaluation of the proposed work has been conducted on the dataset collected from 12 students from Faculty of Engineering and Technology, University of Sindh. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results over existing works. We also carried out a comparison on random faces acquired from the Internet to perform face recognition and results shows that the proposed HN framework is resilient to the randomly acquired faces.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years the ever-expanding internet of things (IoT) is becoming more empowered to revolutionize our world with the advent of cutting-edge features and intelligence in an IoT ecosystem. Thanks to the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis, processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing, storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances. We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware of IoT devices. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Privacy and security have become the most pressing issues in the IoT network, especially in the smart home. Nevertheless, there are still many smart home devices that have not implemented security and privacy policies. This study proposes a remote sensor control system built on ESP32 to implement a smart home through the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) protocol by applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key. It addresses security issues in the smart home by encrypting messages sent from users to sensors. Besides ESP32, the system implementation also uses Raspberry Pi and smartphone with Android applications. The network was analyzed using Wireshark, and it showed that the message sent was encrypted. This implementation could prevent brute force attacks, with the result that it could guarantee the confidentiality of a message. Meanwhile, from several experiments conducted in this study, the difference in the average time of sending encrypted and unencrypted messages was not too significant, i.e., 20 ms.  © 2021 IEEE.},

The system prototype was built using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method with tools and materials such as motion sensor components and sound sensors as detectors, processing components using a single board computer type Raspberry Pi and output components such as buzzer alarms and internet modems. The test method uses a box house simulation construction. Motion detection testing is done by simulating the hand movements in the box. While the sound detection test is carried out by giving a hand sound on the inside of the box house. From the two tests, the system detects motion and sound then activates an alarm, and simultaneously sends home security notifications to users via the Telegram social media application. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

With the help of Alexa Echo device, Raspberry Pi, OpenDNS, and some networking configuration we could implement a comprehensive network control solution. Previous research gave us the idea that a small device like Raspberry Pi could be a good and cheap solution for that purpose. With the Pi4 release it got even more obvious to try using this device as main DNS server for the whole network. It will run in the background of the home environment controlling the whole traffic that goes through the router. Every device connected to the network however will be having the benefits of non-distracting and quicker internet. In addition, the feature of controlling the network with the simple voice command through Alexa device will be a handy additional functionality to PwD and whole network. In the future project this whole setup could be adjusted to prevent any malicious attack with the help of AI assistance and Machine learning algorithms.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The single-board computer (SBC) is a compact, powerful and cost-effective system on chip (SOC) that can perform all complex tasks that may be executed by the desktop computer. Further, with the development of the SBCs having a powerful processor and high RAM support-they are already deployed in many applications such as in agriculture, home security, automation, drones, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and like-wise. However, each SBC has a unique capability and therefore some SBC may perform better than others depending upon the application. Further, some SBC has high processing power but they are either costly or support fewer I/O pins. Similarly, some SBC are cost-effective, has a high number of I/O pins but they have quite less processing power for executing complex instructions and tasks. In addition, for some SBC there is no dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) available that can be used to program SBC according to the user-specific need. Due to these above-mentioned problems, the user has to either invest in the high processing power SBC (having high price) but compromise with less I/O pins or invest in the SBC (having low price) that has the high number of I/O pins but compromise with low processing power (although there are some SBCs available in the market that has high processing power along with the high number of I/O pins. But they are available at a quite high price so we are not considering these SBCs). In both cases, the user is not able to integrate intelligent high processing sensors and equip the system in which SBC is used with new features over time. To over this problem, we are introducing a smart and highly intelligent hybrid implementation of Raspberry pi model 3b+ with Arduino UNO board for controlling UGV. During testing, we have found that our developed hybrid SBC system for UGV work quite impressively. The CPU utilization and CPU temperature readings of the hybrid system are noted while performing various complex tasks on the UGV. Further during the evaluation process, it is observed that UGV consumed a maximum of 80% of system CPU utilization to perform all the allocated tasks efficiently. The rest 20% of the CPU usage as well as some of the GPIO pins of Raspberry pi are reserved and can be used to implement various complex applications in the UGV based on the user requirement.  © 2022 ACM.},

IoTs allow humans to interact and control everyday objects wirelessly to provide more convenience in their lifestyle. The Raspberry Pi is a small, lightweight, and cheap single-board computer that can fit on a human's palm. Security plays a big role in a home. People concern about security by preventing any intruders to enter their home property. Therefore, a smart surveillance monitoring system is proposed to solve this problem by detecting intruders and capturing the images of the intruder. Notifications will also be sent to the user immediately when motions are detected. This smart surveillance monitoring system only stores the images of the intruders that triggered the motion sensor, making this system use significantly less storage space. The proposed Raspberry Pi is connected with a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, a webcam, and an internet connection, the whole device can be configured to carry out the surveillance tasks. The objectives of this project are to design, implement and test the surveillance system using the Raspberry Pi. This proposed surveillance system provides the user with a live stream of the video feed for the user. Whenever a motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, the web camera may capture an image of the intruder and alert the users (owners) through email notifications.  © 2023 Author(s).},

Consequently, many of these devices are equipped with microphones, raising significant privacy concerns: users may not always be aware of when audio recordings are sent to the cloud, or who may gain access to the recordings. In this paper, we present the LeakyPick architecture that enables the detection of the smart home devices that stream recorded audio to the Internet in response to observing a sound. Our proof-of-concept is a LeakyPick device that is placed in a user's smart home and periodically "probes"other devices in its environment and monitors the subsequent network traffic for statistical patterns that indicate audio transmission. Our prototype is built on a Raspberry Pi for less than USD $40 and has a measurement accuracy of 94% in detecting audio transmissions for a collection of 8 devices with voice assistant capabilities. Furthermore, we used LeakyPick to identify 89 words that an Amazon Echo Dot misinterprets as its wake-word, resulting in unexpected audio transmission. LeakyPick provides a cost effective approach to help regular consumers monitor their homes for sound-triggered devices that unexpectedly transmit audio to the cloud. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {In the past, securing valuables in our home/office has been a big chore. There is a high probability of any theft during our absence. When such incidents take place, it is often the case that we seek the help of the police and even sometimes we are unable to recover our belongings. One of the most effective ways to address this issue is to inform the homeowner of any burglary. The homeowners can safeguard their valuables if such information is available in time. The purpose of this work is to inform the home owner about any such untoward incident occurs. That is when their secret locker is broken or when any next person tries to look at it, then our proposed solution will intimate the homeowner with relevant information. IoT-based heist detector is to build a smart security system that could be accommodated by all level of peoples by means of cost, low power consumption, and easy implementation. This work covers both hardware (Raspberry Pi) and software parts. The hardware part includes GSM module, camera module, magnetic switch, etc. The proposed solution is connected with an android application (telegram) that helps to receive the captured image and short message service on the incident. So that homeowner can take decision accordingly. The GSM module in the proposed system sends messages and calls to the various mobile numbers as provided by the admin so that there could be very less chances to miss the calls or messages. Since most of the theft could be happening at midnight, most of the people’s phone would be in silent/do not disturb mode so that the system enable us to set such timings, and it automatically rings when it receives call from the GSM. Many security systems have been developed to monitor and secure our property but some of them have very complicated connectivity and their implementation cost is high. This system starts working when the connection between the sensors mounted on the door is disconnected. The test results shows that the proposed IoT-based real-time system outperforms the existing security system in terms of cost, performance, and its unique features. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) with deep learning (DL) is drastically growing and plays a significant role in many applications, including medical and healthcare systems. It can help users in this field get an advantage in terms of enhanced touchless authentication, especially in spreading infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even though there is a number of available security systems, they suffer from one or more of issues, such as identity fraud, loss of keys and passwords, or spreading diseases through touch authentication tools. To overcome these issues, IoT-based intelligent control medical authentication systems using DL models are proposed to enhance the security factor of medical and healthcare places effectively. This work applies IoT with DL models to recognize human faces for authentication in smart control medical systems. We use Raspberry Pi (RPi) because it has low cost and acts as the main controller in this system. The installation of a smart control system using general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of RPi also enhanced the antitheft for smart locks, and the RPi is connected to smart doors. For user authentication, a camera module is used to capture the face image and compare them with database images for getting access. The proposed approach performs face detection using the Haar cascade techniques, while for face recognition, the system comprises the following steps. The first step is the facial feature extraction step, which is done using the pretrained CNN models (ResNet-50 and VGG-16) along with linear binary pattern histogram (LBPH) algorithm. The second step is the classification step which can be done using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

	abstract = {Smart surveillance systems are used to monitor specific areas, such as homes, buildings, and borders, and these systems can effectively detect any threats. In this work, we investigate the design of low-cost multiunit surveillance systems that can control numerous surveillance cameras to track multiple objects (i.e., people, cars, and guns) and promptly detect human activity in real time using low computational systems, such as compact or single board computers. Deep learning techniques are employed to detect certain objects to surveil homes/buildings and recognize suspicious and vital events to ensure that the system can alarm officers of relevant events, such as stranger intrusions, the presence of guns, suspicious movements, and identified fugitives. The proposed model is tested on two computational systems, specifically, a single board computer (Raspberry Pi) with the Raspbian OS and a compact computer (Intel NUC) with the Windows OS. In both systems, we employ components, such as a camera to stream real-time video and an ultrasonic sensor to alarm personnel of threats when movement is detected in restricted areas or near walls. The system program is coded in Python, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to perform recognition. The program is optimized by using a foreground object detection algorithm to improve recognition in terms of both accuracy and speed. The saliency algorithm is used to slice certain required objects from scenes, such as humans, cars, and airplanes. In this regard, two saliency algorithms, based on local and global patch saliency detection are considered. We develop a system that combines two saliency approaches and recognizes the features extracted using these saliency techniques with a conventional neural network. The field results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection, ranging between 34% and 99.9% for different situations. The low percentage is related to the presence of unclear objects or activities that are different from those involving humans. However, even in the case of low accuracy, recognition and threat identification are performed with an accuracy of 100% in approximately 0.7 s, even when using computer systems with relatively weak hardware specifications, such as a single board computer (Raspberry Pi). These results prove that the proposed system can be practically used to design a low-cost and intelligent security and tracking system. © 2021 Sabri and Li. All Rights Reserved.},

Real-time tracking, remote control, intruder protection, gas/fire alarm, and as well as other features are common in smart houses and buildings. In our proposed research work, the major concern is Safety and Security. Firefighting has always been a risky profession, and there have been numerous tragic casualties due to a lack of technological innovation. Furthermore, firefighting methods used today are inadequate and inefficient, as they heavily depend on humans who are susceptible to errors despite their extensive training. A fire extinguishing robot is a technology that may be used for firefighting. In the firefighting domain, the current technology focuses on extinguishing any fire with carbon dioxide if it comes across and then navigating the area to avoid any obstacles on its way. The goal of using IoT to create the robot is to use a camera to see what is going on around it and a Raspberry Pi to monitor the robot’s status. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {For the past few years, the concept of the smart house has gained popularity. The major challenges concerning a smart home include data security, privacy issues, authentication, secure identification, and automated decision-making of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Currently, existing home automation systems address either of these challenges, however, home automation that also involves automated decisionmaking systems and systematic features apart from being reliable and safe is an absolute necessity. The current study proposes a deep learning-driven smart home system that integrates a Convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated decision-making such as classifying the device as “ON” and “OFF” based on its utilization at home. Additionally, to provide a decentralized, secure, and reliable mechanism to assure the authentication and identification of the IoT devices we integrated the emerging blockchain technology into this study. The proposed system is fundamentally comprised of a variety of sensors, a 5 V relay circuit, and Raspberry Pi which operates as a server and maintains the database of each device being used. Moreover, an android application is developed which communicates with the Raspberry Pi interface using the Apache server and HTTP web interface. The practicality of the proposed system for home automation is tested and evaluated in the lab and in real-time to ensure its efficacy. The current study also assures that the technology and hardware utilized in the proposed smart house system are inexpensive, widely available, and scalable. Furthermore, the need for a more comprehensive security and privacy model to be incorporated into the design phase of smart homes is highlighted by a discussion of the risks analysis’ implications including cyber threats, hardware security, and cyber attacks. The experimental results emphasize the significance of the proposed system and validate its usability in the real world. © Copyright 2023 Umer et al.},

	abstract = {In today's world, where everyone wants to keep their valuables safe and secure, video surveillance for observing a particular area has become the need of the hour. To address this problem, we have come up with a solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places, it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs. Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security from hackers. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Security has become a major concern these days especially with the burgeoning rate of thefts and crimes. Studies show that homes without security systems are more likely to be targeted by burglars than those with professionally monitored systems. Security systems are often the first line of defense against break-ins. Today, due to the advancements in technology and in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to envision pervasive connectivity, storage and automation in systems. This paper focuses on designing and developing a model of an IoT-Based security system for homes, banks and offices in need of security. The proposed system has provision for theft and fire detection and sends alerts to the user through a text message. It also captures a number of snapshots of the intruder and mails it to the user. When compared to the other existing systems, the leverage obtained by preferring this system is that the user receives alerts irrespective of his location and whether or not he is connected to the internet or not. This system also consumes less power as the camera is activated and takes snapshots only in the presence of an intruder, unlike the CCTV system, where live feed is recorded round the clock. This system not only notifies the user but also the neighbor so that immediate action could be taken. © 2017 IEEE.},

While this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart homes or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi configured as a network router.

	abstract = {Technology has changed the world. There is a huge growth in technology connected to almost every field. The pace and diversity of advancement is very rapid. Hence, new technology and techniques are coming up and are put to use as per the need. In such advanced scenario, providing security to home has also become a major point of concern. Presently security cameras can be used for the same. But such cameras may be visible to intruders and there is possibility that cameras may be damaged. Hence, in order to serve the purpose, there is a need to find an alternative secure, accurate and quick method. Hence, an effort is made in this paper to design a home security system using Raspberry Pi. System requires Raspberry Pi, Camera, Touch screen and android mobile as hardware components. Python, Node.js and OpenCV libraries are used for software coding. Usually most of the intrusion detection systems click the photo of intruders as soon as the human is detected. But, such systems fail to click photos, so that the intruder can be identified (Face View Photo) and visible. In proposed system, a proper illustrative method is proposed so that the intrusion detection is accurate and photos thus captured are clear, so that intruder is clearly visible. The proposed system is designed as a smart mirror which will provide both information and home security. The system is developed to accept touch and mobile commands. As soon as the intrusion is detected, an alert message along with the identifiable and clear photo (Face view) of intruder will be sent to the owner's/administrator's mobile. The mirror owner can also see the video of deployed environment through the camera fitted on smart mirror. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

IoT applications are spread over various fields like agriculture, healthcare, automotive industry, home automation, and security, etc. Nowadays, Wireless Communication (WC) is becoming an essential tool to link the devices, organizations, and people in the world. In IoT, WC is budding technology and more exploration is needed. This issue motivates the authors to propose generalized framework for WC in IoT. Framework is divided into five phases according to the architecture of IoT. First two phases focus on the configuration of sensors and gateways; third phase explains the cloud integration, fourth phase is about configuration of the server, and fifth phase considers the user interface. Hence, proposed framework does ease the work of IoT application developer. Authors illustrated the framework using the case study of electricity utilization in domestic. The application uses sensors and Raspberry pi for computing and providing electricity usage consumed by home or building using wireless communication between the devices. This provides the awareness to the user about power consumption pattern and better utilization of the electricity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019},

	abstract = {The idea of a smart home is getting attention for the last few years. The key challenges in a smart home are intelligent decision making, secure identification, and authentication of the IoT devices, continuous connectivity, data security, and privacy issues. The existing systems are targeting one or two of these issues whereas a smart home automation system that is not only secure but also has intelligent decision making and analytical abilities is the need of time. In this paper, we present a novel idea of a smart home that uses a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) for intelligent decision making and also uses blockchain technology to ensure identification and authentication of the IoT devices. Emerging blockchain technology plays a vital role by providing a reliable, secure, and decentralized mechanism for identification and authentication of the IoT devices used in the proposed home automation system. Moreover, the SVM classifier is applied to classify the status of devices used in the proposed smart home automation system into one of the two categories, i.e., "ON"and "OFF."This system is based on Raspberry Pi, 5 V relay circuit, and some sensors. A mobile application is developed using the Android platform. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of each appliance. The HTTP web interface and apache server are used for communication among the Android app and Raspberry Pi. The proposed idea is tested in the lab and real life to validate its effectiveness and usefulness. It is also ensured that the hardware and technology used in the proposed idea are cheap, easily available, and replicable. The experimental results highlight its significance and validate the proof of the concept. © 2020 Rizwan Majeed et al.},

	abstract = {Wastage of electricity is one of the main problems which we are facing nowadays. In home and working areas, people will be engaged with too many activities. Sometimes, there might be a chance to forget to turn off various electrical appliances like lights, fans, servers, if there were nobody in the room or area/passage. This leads to huge power consumption. Also, it is very difficult to physically challenged persons and old-age people to access the appliances every time manually. To avoid all such situations, we proposed “Smart Home System.” It is the process of automating home appliances in which the various electric and electronic appliances are wired up to a central computer control system so they can be handled more efficiently. “Smart Home” helps to overcome the problems that usually people face in daily life. Behind this, it needs the involvement of multiple complex hardware components in controlling the smart home project and there is a fair amount of software architecture that is responsible for driving the hardware components. Moreover, there is a need to employ persons to monitor such simple tasks. This manual approach is time-consuming and also very costly. Thus, automation is the better alternative through which these tasks can be completed automatically without human effort and also accessed remotely from anywhere and anytime with less effort. Everyone is showing interest in making their home smarter to ease their daily activities. The proposed Smart Home system has the capability to control the home appliances based on the environment. Here, different boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino UNO are going to be deployed which can take control over the appliances and act accordingly. People can also be notified, if there are any fire/gas leakages inside the home. This security system facilitates the user to take necessary actions as soon as possible to secure their home. It also involves the deployment of different kinds of sensors which can able to detect the object motion, temperature and humidity and fire detection. This application is very simple and can be implemented in all types of homes. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

	abstract = {Home or Office Automation may be described as a system to provide ease of operation of connected devices or appliances. Most commercial environments, during active hours, consume large amounts of energy resources; this could be optimized to the minimum by smartly monitoring and managing the resources. IoT (Internet of Things) enables this to be a possible solution at reasonable cost factors. However, it is important to note that in commercial environments, security is a key factor; corporations cannot depend on opening up their networks to the outside world in order to avail the services offered by currently available smart-devices. Localizing and privatizing the entire automation and control system would be desirable for such domains. The work presented in this paper proposes a solution for such applications which is crucial for the development of Smart Cities as a whole along with Smart Homes. One of the simplest tasks is to switch a light source, HVAC systems or any other electrical equipment on or off, by being physically present in the premises, remotely or automatically based on time or a sensor's reading. Furthermore, the intensity of the light source, the temperature of the HVAC systems and such parameters could also be varied. Development of technology in the field has enabled the production of cheap and small-sized computers like Raspberry Pi which are also known as Single Board Computers (SBC). The prototype designed is equipped with a secure local MQTT link for communication between the control and automation system and the Edge Devices. Additionally, it is equipped with a speech recognition system to give the users a much more intuitive and natural mean to communicate with and control the connected devices. © 2018 IEEE.},

In this paper, we proposed a face recognition security system using Raspberry Pi which can be connected to the smart home system. Eigenface was used the feature extraction, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as the classifier. The output of face recognition algorithm is then connected to the relay circuit, in which it will lock or unlock the magnetic lock placed at the door. Results showed the effectiveness of our proposed system, in which we obtain around 90% face recognition accuracy. We also proposed a hierarchical image processing approach to reduce the training or testing time while improving the recognition accuracy. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {Owing to the large-scale public health crisis arising from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global health system could not adequately deal with the entirety of infections. Consequently, improvisations meant to complement the healthcare systems in remedying the pandemic emerged. “Hospital-at-home” improvisations include the use of wearable technology to triage patients within households before consulting the health institutions. The wearable devices collect physiological and activity data in order to detect or predict the prevalence of the disease. Unfortunately, Do-It-Yourself health improvisations expose citizens to security vulnerabilities and interoperability challenges. This study proposes the adaptation of a prototype developed prior to the pandemic in securing smart homes and to interoperate health wearable devices used in detecting the prevalence of COVID-19 before symptoms manifest. Focus is placed on: 1) Integration of wearables from different vendors to ensure interoperability using the Mozilla WebThings gateway on Raspberry Pi; 2) Use of Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain to secure the data and allow for implementation of legal restrictions through software. The proposed user-centric wearables architecture enhances data privacy through edge and fog computing, whilst opening up Smart Homes to General Data and Protection Regulations (GDPR)-inspired “data portability” and personal data monetization opportunities. © IEOM Society International.},

Earlier, smart locks were used which enhanced the security features of the house. The proposed model can eliminate the concept of lock system as here the security is provided to the door itself. This would result in a safe and secure door with no locks! Controlling the movement of the door is enabled by Raspberry pi and its related embedded software. Also merging IOT with android is has many advantages in terms of security. The motion sensors are used to detect any movement in front of the door. If any person comes in front of the door, a motion is triggered; the image is captured and notified to the owner. Thus in overall proposed system, two technologies are concentrated on, one is motion sensing in the front of the door in real time even if there is no one at home and the second is to control the movement of the door by the smart phone. Thus by connecting a mobile phone to a door, the owner get notified whenever any visitor visits his home and looking up to the images, the owner of the home can send the open door signal for only the trusted visitors. © 2017 IEEE.},

The system works by taking snaps for the guest through a code and camera pi positioned in the doors then, such snaps will be sent to the owner. The proposed system can be extended to be used for different properties and facilities such as banks and office. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart home equipped with sensors and electronic devices as a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) offers great research perspective to explore communication, computation and controlling of physical devices by using real-time processing and analytics. Since CPS like smart home involves the integration of several types of sensors and equipment, therefore reliability, maintainability, security, data storage and cost-effectiveness are some of the critical issues to be addressed. In addition, interactivity and dynamic feedback, context correlation with respect to streaming events and uncertainties in event composition are also identified as major challenging issues. In the present research, a model for CPS is proposed which is a voice-controlled smart home. Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays an important role in dialog system for identifying semantic components in user utterance. The research work includes stream processing, data collection, identification of actions from voice utterance and event-based real-time decision making. The study includes deployment of various sensors and actuators for performing various actions based on voice commands. Raspberry Pi [19] is used as a central node to which various sensors and equipment are connected. It receives voice command from android device and identifies the various intents and slots from the input utterance. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm which enables physical objects to operate over the Internet, and collect and share the data that describe the real physical world. In this ubiquitous environment, due to the heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects, conventional authentication schemes may not meet the IoT security requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated. In this paper, a two-factor inter device mutual authentication scheme for smart home is proposed, where in the first level, the key exchange is performed using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and a public key cryptography in order to validate the identity of devices; and the second level relies on the use of infrared communication to distribute the One-Time Passwords (OTPs) among devices for authentication purpose. The HLPSL language is used to model the proposed protocol, and a security analysis is conducted using the SPAN (Security Protocol Animator for AVISPA (SPAN)/AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Applications) tool, showing that the proposed scheme can achieve the goals of secrecy of secret keys and mutual authentication. A proof-of-concept in the form of a hardware design is also proposed using Raspberry-Pi, Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC), Infrared circuit and a public-key-infrastructure. Experimentally, it is shown that this hardware design can achieve secure device-to-device authentication. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {Before inception of Internet of Things (IoT), personal computers and laptop were used to handle daily tasks of individuals like mail surfing, access to bank portal, observing current temperature, among others. Nowadays, IoT-enabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in IoT. Smart homes have been widely accepted by individuals and organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like: delay, non-web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence, considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the delay during process of e-mail alert.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoTs) are internet computing devices which are connected to everyday objects that can receive and transmit data intelligently. IoTs allow human to interact and control everyday objects wirelessly to provide more convenience in their lifestyle. The Raspberry Pi is a small, lightweight and cheap single board computer that can fit on human’s palm. Security plays a big role in a home. People concern about security by preventing any intruders to enter their home. This is to prevent loss of privacy and assets. The closed-circuit television (CCTV) is one of the device used to monitor the secured area for any intruders. The use of traditional CCTV to monitor the secured area have three limitations, which are requiring a huge volume of storage to store all the videos regardless there are intruders or not, does not notify the users immediately when there are motions detected, and users must always check the CCTV recorded videos regularly to identity any intruders. Therefore, a smart surveillance monitoring system is proposed to solve this problem by detecting intruders and capturing image of the intruder. Notifications will also be sent to the user immediately when motions are detected. This smart surveillance monitoring system only store the images of the intruders that triggered the motion sensor, making this system uses significantly less storage space. The proposed Raspberry Pi is connected with a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, a webcam and internet connection, the whole device can be configured to carry out the surveillance tasks. The objectives of this project are to design, implement and test the surveillance system using the Raspberry Pi. This proposed surveillance system provides the user with live stream of video feed for the user. Whenever a motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, the web camera may capture an image of the intruder and alert the users (owners) through Short Message Service (SMS) and email notifications. The methodology used to develop this system is by using the object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) model. © 2018, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

The developing world market for smart technology is evolving to adopt and adapt to the interconnected world of devices leading to the Internet of Things (IoT) everywhere. This research paper presents the design, development, and deployment of a prototype for the secure wireless home automation system with OpenHAB 2. We employed the use of two (2) high-performance microcontrollers, namely, the Arduino Mega 2560, interfaced with a 16-channel relay, and Raspberry Pi Model B, running the OpenHAB software. The Raspberry Pi functioned as the server to develop a prototype of an automated smart home that is remotely controllable from both a web application and an Android mobile app. In designing a wireless controlled switch for home appliances, two security procedures were implemented, namely, the token-based JSON Web Token (JWT) interface and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) procedures for authentication and data encryption. Our system delivered a home automation system that leverages on the power of the latest version of OpenHAB to maximize productivity and overall home security while making it adaptable to the management of individual devices. When tested, both the developed hardware and software modules performed extremely well to meet the goal of a secured home automation system. Industry-standard penetration testing tools and frameworks, including Aircrack-ng, were utilized; wireless network audit began with a full sweep of the wireless frequencies with excellent results. It also ensures the efficient use of energy in the home as devices are intelligently controlled from both mobile and web applications. The results of the design and implementation of the additional layer for the security of the OpenHAB framework provide various theoretical and practical implications for home automation.  © 2020 Robert A.

The designed system is capable of acting like a regular mirror in case of normal mode of operation and it acts like a smart mirror in a triggered mode of operation. The Smart mirror thus designed is an interactive system which is capable of accepting two modes of input namely touch and mobile based controls. The system is designed to display weather information, temperature and latest news on the mirror. The system is primarily designed as a home Security and Human Monitoring system. The proposed design is thought of as a package bundled with better features, which not only just displays information over screen, but also can be used for providing security. The system is built using hardware units like Raspberry Pi 3 model, touch screen, mobile device, camera and Python coding is used for software part. The system provides security against Intrusion in home. It is done using Background Subtraction along with Simple Frame Difference Approach. Once Intrusion is detected the administrator is sent alert message along with the photo of intruder. The Human Monitoring is implemented using Machine learning technique Yolo with OpenCV. During human monitoring mode of operation, if the Human under monitoring moves out of the vision range of camera, the administrator of Smart Mirror will be sent alert message.

A trustworthy and cost-effective smart IR system that is able to change an IR controllable device into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) device and interconnect them for smart city/home applications is offered in this article. First, a printed circuit board (PCB) consisting of an IR receiver and multiple IR transmitters side by side which are capable of transmitting about 20 m indoors is designed and implemented. This IR transceiver board is the first of its kind. Second, the IR transceiver can be linked up with a Raspberry Pi, for which we develop two software tools, recording and replaying any IR signals so as to put the corresponding IR device in control. Third, a smartphone can be connected to the Pi by means of a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) cloud server so that the commands can be sent by the smartphone to the legacy IR device over the Internet. We have also identified the deficiency of TLS mutual authentication implemented by the popular MQTT open-source package Mosquitto for a trustworthy IoT system and patched the system. We analyze the factors that affect the IR signal transmission distance, discuss the security concerns of our IR transceiver, and illustrate the scenarios for attacks. For instance, TV can be turned off remotely by a drone equipped with the transceiver. © 2014 IEEE.},

The conventional home automation system allows users to control household appliances such as lights, air-conditioning, surveillance camera etc. via smartphone applications, webpages and control panels. One of the major drawbacks is with the operation efficiency, where people would still need their hands on the physical interfaces to access the system. It could be quite inconvenient for specific groups such as the elderly and disabled people, who will not benefit much from such systems. In light of this, the project proposes a methodology and design of a voice-controlled environment with emphasis on speech recognition and voice control based on Amazon Alexa and Raspberry Pi. In this implementation, office users can easily control their office appliances with voice commands, where as the model can be implemented for smart home users as well. The proposed voice-controlled implementation comprises eight main features: 1) Control of wired electrical appliances; 2) Control of Radio Frequency (RF) and Infrared (IR) appliances; 3) YouTube connected entertainment system; 4) Digital memo; 5) Face recognition attendance taking system with SQL database; 6) Security surveillance; 7) Room occupancy detection; 8) Telegram-based voice-controlled text messaging.

The development of hardware equipment for the Internet of Things not only use for industrial but also for smart homes. The smart home covers broad topics, including remote control of home applications, sensing of humans, temperature-controlling air conditions, and security monitors. When we carry out these topics, the human-machine interface is essential for system applications. A gesture recognition system is applied to many real applications. The reason is that the accuracy rate and real factors are complicated. They commonly use of gesture control service in the market is the sensor board of gesture control. The principle is using the electric field to change and determine the gestures. The limitation requires the close operation, and there is a problem of critical point sensitivity. In this paper, we use the gesture control board to combine with gesture image recognition methods to perform the double authentication gesture recognition. Raspberry Pi is the control center to integrate the intelligent light bulb. HUE makes a gesture recognition system.

Mirrors are basically used in home for the purpose of grooming up or getting ready for the day. The same mirrors can be made to behave Smart to provide Security and Vigilance in deployed environment. Smart mirror is a system that not only works as a normal mirror but also provides Security against intrusion inside the home. The proposed system is designed using Raspberry Pi, Camera, Raspberry Pi compatible touch screen and microphone as hardware components and Python for programming. The proposed system can accept 3 modes of input commands namely Voice, Touch and Mobile commands. The Smart mirror can be used as a security system against the Intrusion in home. The Yolo Technique with OpenCV for object detection is used for detection of Intrusion of Human. The Yolo (You Only Look Once) is a Machine Learning concept for the detection of objects. The Yolo is an optimized technique as it looks image only once as compared to other image processing techniques, hence work faster. The Video is converted to frames and the frames are given as input to the Raspberry Pi. The Python programming is used along-with the Yolo technique with OpenCV to detect objects. As soon as the intrusion is confirmed, the administrator of the Smart Mirror will be sent an alert E-mail along-with the photo of an intruder and the details are stored in the storage device. The voice and Touch screen commands can be used whenever an administrator/owner is in front of the mirror. The mobile based controls can be used when the administrator/owner of the mirror is away from the mirror.

In this paper we take the concept of smart home systems and add additional security features to the concept to make living safe and secure along with comfortable and cozy. Using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, our system alerts the user when an unknown person is detected within the household so that they can take the required steps needed in case it is an unwanted intruder. In the modern, fast paced world we live in, where security threats grow in large numbers each day, the need for home security increases with the same intensity. A smarter, more efficient and a more convenient approach towards home security ensures an increase in the number of people having access to such systems as well as makes sure of a decrease in the number of people having difficulty with confusing and complex security interfaces. This project turns your mundane everyday object into defenders of your home, eliminating the need to bring in any other expensive security devices. Additionally, it also lets you keep a track of your entire household objects in one place. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of devices are being connected to each other every day. Each connectivity opens the door to new possibilities to make a person's life easier and convenient. A smart home is one such area impacted by IoT which greatly improves a person's life by helping them create a secure environment for his family and carry out his day-to-day activities with ease. Focusing primarily in the context of Nepal where available smart systems are either expensive or lack basic features, this paper essentially deals with the design and implementation of a cost-efficient smart home system focusing on remote surveillance, monitoring different aspects (movement detections, surveillance and temperature and humidity) of a home with notification alerts. Furthermore, the system also aims to reduce electricity usage and minimize energy consumption by helping a person automate their everyday tasks such as turning on/off lights, thermostats, etc. by detecting their presence. Raspberry Pi is the heart of the home system managing all of these services. In addition, Amazon Cloud Services, Simple Email Service (SES) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) are used for notifying users/home-owners. The product could further be regarded as a prototype and additional features could be added on top of it to create one's own version of 'smart home'. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A robust door lock system is the first and foremost thing to assure security to a home/building. Due to the ever-increasing responsibilities and daily tasks, people spend most of the time away from their homes. In such situations, identifying a visitor and getting remote access to their home is indispensable. A smart door lock which can be completely monitored and controlled from a remote location using an android application on a smartphone is proposed in this paper. When a visitor presses a calling bell/push button at the door, a Raspberry Pi with HD camera gets powered up and notifies the owner with a message and streams visitors' live identity on owner's mobile over the Internet. The owner, based on his willingness, can easily open/close the door remotely by entering a password that was preset. In addition, he can also convey an audio message to the visitor by entering the corresponding text in his smartphone app. The proof of concept provided in this paper emphasizes the real-time remote accessibility in the owner's hand (smartphone) on an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) over a cloud server. © 2019 IEEE.},

This paper presents design and implementation of a ubiquitous home controlling and monitoring system that uses an inexpensive Raspberry PI as the home automation hub to connect with various household devices. Via smartphones or tablets, home owners can remotely and continuously monitor their home environment including temperature, humidity, security, and energy consumption and adjust it to a desired level, thereby gaining more security and energy saving. As an initial step, we evaluated and compared three IoT application layer protocols REST, CoAP and MQTT and our findings suggest MQTT outperforms the other two in the smart home we aim to build. Moreover, using a Raspberry PI as the home automation hub can overcome the interoperability challenges facing commercial home automation components. Our experience shows that the line of code (LOC) for adding a new device to the home automation hub is about 60 lines of Java code. We hope this work can benefit research in the smart home.

In recent days when ever house is locked the break-ins number has been increased enormously. So in order to provide security to the home this presented paper is helpful. When the intruders enters into the house, image of the intruder is captured by the system, even if intruder escapes Police need to caught the intruder to recover the stolen things which needs the picture of the intruder to the police. The planned system captures the picture of the intruder and sends it to the authorized mail through internet over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). So security to the home is provided more effectively in the smart way of communicating the things. Home appliances are smartly automated to reduce the human effort for intelligent decisions with the help of Internet Of Things (IoT). This compact and lightweight product is designed to provide security and to control home appliances in the house by the owner through IoT servers.

The Internet of things is the network of interconnecting devices (may be physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc.) embedded with electronics, sensors, etc., to exchange data. Nowadays, home systems are equipped with computing and information technology which provides them with smartness and intellect. Since doors are the gateway to our homes, therefore it is necessary to make them more secure. Currently available mechanism of providing secure access to doors includes bare-metal locks and some smart locking systems. The smart locking system’s performance can be evaluated on the basis of identification accuracy, intrusiveness, and cost. In this paper, we introduce the idea to provide secure access to home. It will be achieved through smart doorbell which is a cost-effective alternative to currently its counterparts. Our system connects WiFi-enabled Android devices with firebase server using Raspberry Pi and enables user to answer the door when the doorbell is pressed. It learns to identify new user by using face recognition as a unique identity to authenticate the individual. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

The decision to utilize a certain cryptographic algorithm, is mainly based on a tradeoff between security and performance, i.e. power consumption. A benchmark of these different cryptographic algorithms on IoT platforms is a must for security architects while designing their protocols and schemes. This paper presents a benchmark of the most known cryptographic algorithms on the Raspberry Pi platform, with a comparison with Arduino benchmark results provided in the literature. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in the Internet, web and communication technologies cut across many areas of modern-day living and enabled interconnection of every physical object, including, sensors and actuators. Web-enabled smart objects empower innovative services and applications for different domains and improve utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose an interoperable Internet-of-Things (IoTs) platform for a smart home system using a Web-of-Objects (WoO) and cloud architecture. The proposed platform controls the home appliances from anywhere and also provides the homes’ data in the cloud for various service providers’ applications and analysis. Firstly, we proposed a Raspberry PI based gateway for interoperability among various legacy home appliances, different communication technologies, and protocols. Secondly, we bring the smart home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we will provide the cloud server for smart homes’ to store the homes’ data due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for various application's service providers and analysis. In the proposed smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for web-based controlling. We aim to reduce the human intervention, secure access control to home devices from anywhere, provide smart homes data for application services as well as for analysis, and improve the utilization of resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

To address the requirements of securing IoT devices in edge home networks, this paper proposed a strategy capable of securing the network against most malicious activity in real-time. Firstly, we use an edge smart gateway, which is deployed on a Raspberry-Pi, runs an SDN controller and Open vSwtich (OVS) to perform traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. Then, with limited resources available on edge gateway, we use a lightweight machine-learning algorithm to classify device to device traffic and identify if there is a network intrusion. The classification model extracts features of network traffic, trained by classic supervised learning method-Decision Tree J48, then distinguish between benign and malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. Simulation results show that the model has high accuracy of intrusion and can effectively ensure security of home IoT interactions. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things(IoT) has made it possible to set up a smart home security through which you can decide who can enter your home using your smartphone and web application. It's also made it simple and relatively affordable to monitor your home anytime and anywhere. the key issue in a traditional home security system is, it is easily breakable and quite outdated. This in turns, results in the robbery and also needs installation of the costly security system. To tackle this problem, we propose a smart home security system, which is IoT as well as face recognition enabled. In our system, the web camera is used which is connected to the raspberry pi accompanied by sensors such as Passive Infrared(Pir) and Ultrasonic sensor. On motion detection camera captures an image of the person in front of the door then real-time face recognition is done using local binary pattern (LBP). If person's image matches with one of the home members then the door will unlock, else doorbell will ring. if an intruder tries to break door then an alarm will be raised at the same time SMS and Email containing image of the intruder will be sent to the homeowner. Face recognition works well in multi-face recognition and stranger identification, which meet the requirement of home security. This system is battery powered in case of power failure. Furthermore, the house owner can keep track of activity happening in the house using android and web application connected to the raspberry pi using the internet. Using Android application or web application owner can also add new person's faces into the databases eg., guests. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Voice-based command recognition is commonly used in security systems, phones, household appliances and hardware designed for handicapped people. Most of the current research study the voice command recognition for the smart home in English. Lack of study for voice command recognition in Malay makes it challenging to apply the voice command services for the smart home in Malaysia. Also, voice recognition is a non-trivial task in natural language processing. This project is to identify the command used for smart home appliances using Malay and design the algorithm for this system. Then, the proposed algorithm will be deployed on a Raspberry Pi to see the performance of Malay command in accuracy and the suitability of the algorithm to be deployed on low cost embedded devices. Light, fan, and television had been chosen as electrical appliances to build the command. An algorithm that previously used to recognize songs, the robust quad algorithm, is used in this project for voice command recognition. The proposed method has two main processes, known as feature extraction and voice recognition. In the feature extraction process, the audio fingerprint will extract data from the command spectral peak. For voice recognition, audio fingerprint matching will be used to analyze the audio commands. The outcome of this project is when the voice command is given by the user by activate or deactivate the target home appliance. The second outcome is the background noise that affects the system is reduced by using robust quad algorithm and increase the accuracy of the system. The results of this project have shown that the proposed algorithm is suitable to be implemented on a Raspberry Pi and achieve a high recognition rate with 87%. In the presence of noise with 15 dB, the proposed algorithm can maintain the high recognition rate with 82%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The protocol leverages identity-based cryptography (IBC), thus relaxing the requirement for storing and managing public key certificates. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks associated with centralized key generation in IBC, we opt to generate the private keys in a distributed manner, involving all smart devices. We implemented our protocol on Raspberry Pi 3 devices and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of both computational and communication cost. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Through to technique and hardware improvements, the human can handle more significant data than before. Machine learning is a way to achieve artificial intelligence, using difference algorithm to process difference type data, let the system analyzing, learning, processing data like the way of a human. The Artificial neural network has many types, such as the Recurrent Neural Network that good at handling continuity data, the situation like speech recognition, since speech is continuity, different letters combination with the various meaning, so continuity data is essential to speech recognition. Raspberry Pi is an excellent Internet of Things device because it is a kind of micro-computer, you can install the operating system in it. The function is as a base; you can expand different modules. For example, if we want to collect image information, we can install the lens module, if we’re going to obtain sound data, we need to install the microphone module. The current raspberry pi already has WIFI and Bluetooth, so the raspberry pie is currently one of the favorite choices for IoT devices. In this paper, we want to apply the technique of face recognition and speech recognition in life, using a raspberry pi to build a home security system. We proposed an architecture that combines face recognition and voice recognition to develop a home security system. Through face and voice recognition, we double-checking the identity is correct or not to improve convenience and security of the smart home environment. Raspberry Pi is the home security system’s kernel and uses lens module to collect face information and microphone module to collect voice information. Raspberry Pi upload the data to the face API and speaker recognition system. The face API is used to recognize face information; the speech API is used to identify voice information. When the identity of the face API result is equal to the character of the speech API result, it is completing the verification requirement; the system will continue next step to control devices, like an electronic lock or other devices that supported remote control. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This system uses Haar-like features for face detection and Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) for face recognition. The system also includes a web-based remote monitoring, an authentication module, and a bare-bones embedded IoT server, which transmits the live pictures of the visitors via email along with an SMS notification, and the owner can then remotely control the lock by responding to the email with predefined security codes to unlock the door. This system finds wide applications in smart homes where the physical presence of the owner at all times is not possible, and where a remote authentication and control is desired.

	abstract = {Enhancing the home security by remote control means is a cutting-edge research area in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT's). The necessity of security is increasing these days, ranging from thefts, burglary, accidents, LPG gas leakage and fire detection etc, which all are important aspects of a Home Security System. In this paper, a prototype Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home (SSH) model is developed. Generally a home security system uses signals in terms of alarm of intruder detection. However, the proposed Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home uses a mobile communication (GSM) based Home Security System, which helps to provide a better security to have systems that can be globally connected. In the proposed system a text message is sent, whenever an event from any sensor is detected, so that immediate actions could be taken by the home owner. The proposed SSH sends SMS using GSM-Module and mail through Raspberry Pi micro-controller. The prototype SSH based smart system also uses an Arduino micro-controller board for commands processing and control. The system uses GSM technology, which provides global access to the Smart Home Security System. The prototype SSH, developed at a low cost, can be used for converting existing homes into smart homes at relatively affordable cost and with convenience. The performance testing results of the prototype SSH are encouraging. © 2016 IEEE.},

User behavior identified when various access points changed states. The combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication are used to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attacks. In the experiment, the proposed logical sensing algorithm successfully implemented for a month in a studio apartment.

	abstract = {Smart Grid is a major element of the Smart City concept that enables two-way communication of energy data between electric utilities and their consumers. These communication technologies are going through sharp modernization to meet future demand growth and to achieve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid. In this paper, we implement an IPv6 based two-way communication system between the transformer agent (TA), installed at local electric transformer and various customer agents (CAs), connected to customer's smart meter. Various homes share their energy usage with the TA which in turn sends the utility's recommendations to the CAs. Raspberry Pi is used as hardware for all the CAs and the TA. We implement a self-healing mesh network between all nodes using OpenLab IEEE 802.15.4 chips and Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and the data is secured by RSA/AES keys. Several tests have been conducted in real environments, inside and outside of Carleton University, to test the performance of this communication network in various obstacle settings. In this paper, we highlight the details behind the implementation of this IPv6-based smart grid communication system, the related challenges, and the proposed solutions. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Home automation means controlling of home functions and features automatically and sometimes remotely using one or more computers. An automated home is also called as a smart home. Speech based home automation uses human voice commands to operate the electrical appliances in the home. It is very useful for human beings especially for elderly and physically handicapped people. In this paper, we present the implementation details of two schemes for speech based home automation and control. The first scheme uses the Bluetooth technology for controlling of electrical appliances when we are at home. It uses a HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino Bluetooth controller mobile application for switching on or off the appliances. The second scheme uses GSM/GPRS technology for controlling the electrical appliances. The developed system also alerts the user about any intrusion into the house when we are away from the home. This system is implemented on ARM11 Raspberry Pi microcontroller board. Python integrated development environment (IDE) is used for developing the necessary software. Relays and bulbs are used as load to demonstrate the working of the prototype system. Home automation system gives accessibility, comfort, energy efficiency, security by providing control and monitoring of appliances, security surveillance. © 2016 IEEE.},
