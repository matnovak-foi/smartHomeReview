abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has assumed a pivotal role in the
advancement of communication technology and in our daily lives. However,
an IoT system such as a smart grid with poorly designed topology and
weak security protocols might be vulnerable to cybercrimes. Exploits may
arise from sensor data interception en route to the intended consumer
within an IoT system. The increasing integration of electronic devices
interconnected via the internet has galvanized the acceptance of this
technology. Nonetheless, as the number of users of this technology
surges, there must be an aligned concern to ensure that security
measures are diligently enforced within IoT communication systems, such
as in smart homes, smart cities, smart factories, smart hospitals, and
smart grids. This research addresses security lacunae in the topology
and configuration of IoT energy monitoring systems using post-quantum
cryptographic techniques. We propose tailored implementations of the
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), N-th degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units
(NTRU), and a suite of cryptographic primitives based on Module
LearningWith Rounding (Saber) as post-quantum cryptographic candidate
algorithms for IoT devices. These aim to secure publisher-subscriber
end-to-end communication in energy system monitoring. Additionally, we
offer a comparative analysis of these tailored implementations on
low-resource devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, during data transmission
using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Results
indicate that the customized implementation of NTRU outperforms both
SABER and RSA in terms of CPU and memory usage, while Light SABER
emerges as the front-runner when considering encryption and decryption
delays.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development in the field of wireless technologies led to the appearance of a new topic, known as the Internet of things (IoT). The IoT applications can be found in various fields of our life, such as smart home, health care, smart building, and etc. In all these applications, the data collected from the real world are transmitted through the Internet; therefore, these data have become a target of many attacks and hackers. Hence, a secure communication must be provided to protect the transmitted data from unauthorized access. This paper focuses on designing a secure IoT system to protect the sensing data. In this system, the security is provided by the use of Lightweight AES encryption algorithm to encrypt the data received from physical environment. The hardware used in this proposal is the Raspberry Pi 3 model B and two types of sensors. The LAES algorithm was embedded inside the Raspberry in order to protect the sensing data, that come from sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi, before sending them through the network. The analysis results show that the proposed IoT security system consumes less time in encryption/decryption and has high throughput when compared with others from related work. Its throughput is higher in about 19.24{\%} than the value reported for one system in the related studies. {\textcopyright} 2021 University of Baghdad-College of Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The advent of smart homes has revolutionized residential living, integrating advanced technologies and intelligent devices to create secure, comfortable, and efficient environments. However, this integration of diverse smart devices has brought significant cybersecurity challenges. Detecting and analyzing abnormal network packets have become paramount, signifying potential intrusions, malicious activities, or system errors and ensuring the security and stability of smart home systems. Machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Random Forests, have shown promise in addressing these challenges. However, most research has concentrated on anomaly detection rather than malicious activity in smart homes. The vast datasets collected from various scenarios pose methodological and algorithmic challenges for applying machine learning techniques. To fill these research gaps, our study introduces traditional machine-learning methods for detecting abnormal network packets in smart homes using the IoT-23 dataset. It involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features, and training various machine learning models. The correlation matrix helps validate the feature selection of the best models based on performance metrics like precision, F1-score, recall, accuracy ratio, training score, and training time cost. Additionally, the study classifies 12 types of malicious malware across different machine learning models, considering performance within the context of smart home devices. This study implements real-time anomaly detection on the Raspberry Pi using packet captures and Zeek flowmeter methods. The findings contribute insights into models suitable for smart home security. In addition, our research enhances the understanding and application of machine learning methods for bolstering security in smart homes. {\textcopyright} 2023 ACM.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm which enables physical
objects to operate over the Internet, and collect and share the data
that describe the real physical world. In this ubiquitous environment,
due to the heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security
protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects,
conventional authentication schemes may not meet the IoT security
requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated.
In this paper, a two-factor inter device mutual authentication scheme
for smart home is proposed, where in the first level, the key exchange
is performed using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and a public key
cryptography in order to validate the identity of devices; and the
second level relies on the use of infrared communication to distribute
the One-Time Passwords (OTPs) among devices for authentication purpose.
The HLPSL language is used to model the proposed protocol, and a
security analysis is conducted using the SPAN (Security Protocol
Animator for AVISPA (SPAN)/AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet
Security Protocol and Applications) tool, showing that the proposed
scheme can achieve the goals of secrecy of secret keys and mutual
authentication. A proof-of-concept in the form of a hardware design is
also proposed using Raspberry-Pi, Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC),
Infrared circuit and a public-key-infrastructure. Experimentally, it is
shown that this hardware design can achieve secure device-to-device

abstract = {Owing to the large-scale public health crisis arising from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global health system could not adequately deal with the entirety of infections. Consequently, improvisations meant to complement the healthcare systems in remedying the pandemic emerged. “Hospital-at-home” improvisations include the use of wearable technology to triage patients within households before consulting the health institutions. The wearable devices collect physiological and activity data in order to detect or predict the prevalence of the disease. Unfortunately, Do-It-Yourself health improvisations expose citizens to security vulnerabilities and interoperability challenges. This study proposes the adaptation of a prototype developed prior to the pandemic in securing smart homes and to interoperate health wearable devices used in detecting the prevalence of COVID-19 before symptoms manifest. Focus is placed on: 1) Integration of wearables from different vendors to ensure interoperability using the Mozilla WebThings gateway on Raspberry Pi; 2) Use of Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain to secure the data and allow for implementation of legal restrictions through software. The proposed user-centric wearables architecture enhances data privacy through edge and fog computing, whilst opening up Smart Homes to General Data and Protection Regulations (GDPR)-inspired “data portability” and personal data monetization opportunities. {\textcopyright} IEOM Society International.},

The Artificial neural network has many types, such as the Recurrent Neural Network that good at handling continuity data, the situation like speech recognition, since speech is continuity, different letters combination with the various meaning, so continuity data is essential to speech recognition. Raspberry Pi is an excellent Internet of Things device because it is a kind of micro-computer, you can install the operating system in it. The function is as a base; you can expand different modules. For example, if we want to collect image information, we can install the lens module, if we're going to obtain sound data, we need to install the microphone module. The current raspberry pi already has WIFI and Bluetooth, so the raspberry pie is currently one of the favorite choices for IoT devices. In this paper, we want to apply the technique of face recognition and speech recognition in life, using a raspberry pi to build a home security system. We proposed an architecture that combines face recognition and voice recognition to develop a home security system. Through face and voice recognition, we double-checking the identity is correct or not to improve convenience and security of the smart home environment. Raspberry Pi is the home security system's kernel and uses lens module to collect face information and microphone module to collect voice information. Raspberry Pi upload the data to the face API and speaker recognition system. The face API is used to recognize face information; the speech API is used to identify voice information. When the identity of the face API result is equal to the character of the speech API result, it is completing the verification requirement; the system will continue next step to control devices, like an electronic lock or other devices that supported remote control. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication are used to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attacks. In the experiment, the proposed logical sensing algorithm successfully implemented for a month in a studio apartment. During the course of the experiment, the algorithm understands all the state changes of the primary and secondary access points and user identity was verified 55 times by generating 14 warnings and 5 alarms. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract = {There is rapid interest growing in the use of smart, connected devices.
The developing world market for smart technology is evolving to adopt
and adapt to the interconnected world of devices leading to the Internet
of Things (IoT) everywhere. This research paper presents the design,
development, and deployment of a prototype for the secure wireless home
automation system with OpenHAB 2. We employed the use of two (2)
high-performance microcontrollers, namely, the Arduino Mega 2560,
interfaced with a 16-channel relay, and Raspberry Pi Model B, running
the OpenHAB software. The Raspberry Pi functioned as the server to
develop a prototype of an automated smart home that is remotely
controllable from both a web application and an Android mobile app. In
designing a wireless controlled switch for home appliances, two security
procedures were implemented, namely, the token-based JSON Web Token
(JWT) interface and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) procedures for
authentication and data encryption. Our system delivered a home
automation system that leverages on the power of the latest version of
OpenHAB to maximize productivity and overall home security while making
it adaptable to the management of individual devices. When tested, both
the developed hardware and software modules performed extremely well to
meet the goal of a secured home automation system. Industry-standard
penetration testing tools and frameworks, including Aircrack-ng, were
utilized; wireless network audit began with a full sweep of the wireless
frequencies with excellent results. It also ensures the efficient use of
energy in the home as devices are intelligently controlled from both
mobile and web applications. The results of the design and
implementation of the additional layer for the security of the OpenHAB
framework provide various theoretical and practical implications for
home automation.},

In addition, they have the potential to connect people to many services on the market to gain access. Security is one of the issues with the user accessing the data through the connected network. In essence, the public network is more vulnerable and the information transferred to systems is not properly encrypted. Furthermore, the network is accessible to anyone those who have the understanding of the computer network. The intruders may use the public network to plough the freedom users from surfing internet by blocking with their websites or advertisements. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network that uses their encryption mechanism to link two different networks together using public telecommunications and to providing services through World Wide Web. In this paper, a prototype model is designed for VPN gateway connection using Raspberry Pi which in turn to connect the house network with the ISP network. Through this a VPN network services like security and scalability is guaranteed to the home systems using the proposed prototype. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

Raspberry Pi is one such technology which made a strong influence to control any electronic devices even from the remote areas.

For the useful utilization of power very effectively, certain human errors happening unintentionally need to be reduced, like to switch off home appliances; the home automation system has to be designed in such a way that they need to control all electronic devices of a house remotely in a secured and safe manner.

the use of a smart contract on a private Ethereum Blockchain (also known

However, cyber attackers are deploying Evil Twin and Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, among others, to penetrate the network, establish rogue Wi-Fi access points and trick victims into connecting to it, leading to interceptions, manipulation, exploitation, compromising the smart devices and taking command and control.

Secondly, we created a virtual environment using Kali Linux (Raspberry Pi) and NetGear r7000 as the home router for our testbed.

In this paper, we revisit the security of IR remote control schemes and examine their security assumptions under the settings of internet-connected smart homes. We focus on two specific questions: (1) whether IR signals could be sniffed by an IoT device; and (2) what information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals. To answer these questions, we design a sniff module using a commercial-off-the-shelf IR receiver on a Raspberry Pi and show that the Infrared (IR) signal emanating from the remote control of a Smart TV can be captured by one of the nearby IoT devices, for example, a smart air-conditioner, even the signal is not aimed at the air-conditioner. The IR signal range and receiving angle are larger than most have thought. We also developed algorithms to extract semantic information from the sniffed IR control signals, and evaluated with real-world applications. The results showed that lots of sensitive information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals, including account name and password, PIN code, and even payment information.},

more empowered to revolutionize our world with the advent of
cutting-edge features and intelligence in an IoT ecosystem. Thanks to
the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to
technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent
occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous
devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a
comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the
innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud
computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based
autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is
challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a
rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to
provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a
smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed
a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to
control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud
computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality
of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis,
processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT
sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing,
storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of
distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as
microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through
REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the
functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption
and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances.
We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart
home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application
against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded
edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the
implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware
of IoT devices.},

In case of any odd behavior or any critical signs and symptoms are recognized, the caretaker in addition to medical doctors are notified by right way through the message or E-mail. To design an efficient Remote Monitoring System, Security is of paramount importance. subsequently to provide security to the patient's data Shamir's Secret key Sharing Algorithm is used in which data and keys will get split, saved at different location and to retrieve them threshold cryptography is used. For Heart Disease diagnosis the prediction algorithm support vector machine(SVM) is used. Therefore the system presents quality healthcare to all. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {For the past few years, the concept of the smart house has gained
popularity. The major challenges concerning a smart home include data
security, privacy issues, authentication, secure identification, and
automated decision-making of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Currently, existing home automation systems address either of these
challenges, however, home automation that also involves automated
decision -making systems and systematic features apart from being
reliable and safe is an absolute necessity. The current study proposes a
deep learning-driven smart home system that integrates a Convolutional
neural network (CNN) for automated decision-making such as classifying
the device as ``ON{\{}''{\}} and ``OFF{\{}''{\}} based on its utilization at home.
Additionally, to provide a decentralized, secure, and reliable mechanism
to assure the authentication and identification of the IoT devices we
integrated the emerging blockchain technology into this study. The
proposed system is fundamentally comprised of a variety of sensors, a 5
V relay circuit, and Raspberry Pi which operates as a server and
maintains the database of each device being used. Moreover, an android
application is developed which communicates with the Raspberry Pi
interface using the Apache server and HTTP web interface. The
practicality of the proposed system for home automation is tested and
evaluated in the lab and in real-time to ensure its efficacy. The
current study also assures that the technology and hardware utilized in
the proposed smart house system are inexpensive, widely available, and
scalable. Furthermore, the need for a more comprehensive security and
privacy model to be incorporated into the design phase of smart homes is
highlighted by a discussion of the risks analysis' implications
including cyber threats, hardware security, and cyber attacks. The
experimental results emphasize the significance of the proposed system
and validate its usability in the real world.},

increasingly adding voice assistant and audio monitoring features to a
wide range of devices including smart speakers, televisions,

these devices are equipped with microphones, raising significant privacy
concerns: users may not always be aware of when audio recordings are
sent to the cloud, or who may gain access to the recordings. In this
paper, we present the LeakyPick architecture that enables the detection
of the smart home devices that stream recorded audio to the Internet in
response to observing a sound. Our proof-of-concept is a LeakyPick

transmissions for a collection of 8 devices with voice assistant
capabilities. Furthermore, we used LeakyPick to identify 89 words that
an Amazon Echo Dot misinterprets as its wake-word, resulting in
unexpected audio transmission. LeakyPick provides a cost effective
approach to help regular consumers monitor their homes for

abstract = {Anomaly detection in smart homes is paramount in the prevailing information age as smart devices remain susceptible to sophisticated cyber-attacks. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and insecure, unencrypted data transfer to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Sensible deployment of conventional security measures is jeopardized by the heterogeneity and resource constraints of smart devices. This article presents a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to detect anomalous behavior in smart home environments. We prototype a smart camera using Raspberry Pi and gather power traces for normal activity. Furthermore, we model DDoS attacks on the experimental setup and generate attack traces of power consumption. Besides, we compare the performances of several machine learning models for accurate prediction of the presence of anomalies. A deep feed-forward neural network model achieves an accuracy of 99.2{\%} compared to other models. Empirical evaluations of the proposed concept affirm that power consumption is a promising parameter in detecting anomalies in smart homes. The proposed method is suitable for smart homes as it does not impose additional overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of embedded devices has led to the growth of the
Internet of Things (IoT) with applications in numerous domains such as
home automation, healthcare, education and agriculture. However, many of
the connected devices particularly in smart homes are the target of
attacks that try to exploit security vulnerabilities such as hard-coded
passwords and insecure data transfer. Recent studies show that there is
a considerable surge in the number of phishing attacks targeting smart
homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many of the existing user
authentication protocols in the literature incur additional
computational overhead and need to be made more resilient to smart home
targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight and
privacy-preserving remote user authentication protocol for securing
smart home applications. Our approach is based on Photo Response
Non-Uniformity (PRNU) to make our protocol resilient to smart home
attacks such as smartphone capture attacks and phishing attacks. In
addition, the lightweight nature of our solution is suitable for
deployment on heterogeneous and resource constrained IoT devices.
Besides, we leverage geometric secret sharing for establishing mutual
authentication among the participating entities. We validate the
security of the proposed protocol using the AVISPA formal verification
tool and prototype it on a Raspberry Pi to analyze the power
consumption. Finally, a comparison with existing schemes reveals that
our scheme incurs a 20{\%} reduction in communication overhead on smart
devices. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is usable as it absolves users
from memorizing passwords and carrying smart cards.},

It is used to restrict access to a system, application, or service to only those users who have the authorization to use the system or device. Because of increased computing power, modern passwords must be very long and complicated, which will make them hard to remember. Some research studies show that it is easier for people to remember visual passwords instead of textual ones. Therefore, this research aims to enhance the authentication process's security using the graphical pattern unlock approach on Raspberry Pi. The grid size of 5 × 5 was selected in the implementation, as it provides the tradeoff between security strength and an easy pattern to remember. The proposed system could be connected to the smart home system, which can enhance their security.

Owing to the numerous benefits brought about by smart homes, research on the topic has been increasing at an exponential rate, bringing quality properties such as security, usability, reliability, and others. Despite their various advantages, smart homes have not been in a positive spotlight regarding security and reliability. The main reason that people are hesitant towards adopting an implemented intelligent system at their domicile is due to the lack of trust they allocate to the electronics. As such, this paper provides insights on an innovative and low-cost smart home monitoring system named RaspiMonitor. While the central aim of the system is to offer a robust smart home architecture which discreetly caters for the safety and security of its environment, it also helps in reducing energy wastage. The RaspiMonitor was carefully designed using dynamic web-based services in addition to an evaluation which quantified its usability and acceptance through the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with 6 constructs. Results in principle portray acceptance of the system with a mean score of 4.47. This indicates that a robust hardware and software architecture such as the RaspiMonitor is useful, convenient, and easy to use. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {The privacy and security have been becoming the most exigent tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) network. The worst enemy could be the IoT without the security and privacy policies. MQTT depends on TCP as per the transport protocol, and by default the encrypted communication is not being utilized by the connection. This paper investigates the approach of applying Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for smart home communication in MQTT based IoT network. A prototype of network of smart homes is implemented and the data transmission reception is done using MQTT protocol. AES payload encryption with MQTT is done and the network is analysed for privacy and efficiency. Brute force attack is considered for testing the confidentiality and integrity of the data. The hardware setup of the network is implemented using Raspberry pi. {\textcopyright} 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, a secure transmission method based on the wireless vision sensor network (WVSN) using the surveillance system was proposed. The computation task has been divided between the sensor node and the central server. A low complexity algorithm was calculated on the sensor node, and the central server computed the high operation algorithm. We also proposed the foreground segmentation algorithm to get the foreground mask which can protect the user security. Based on this technique, we have implemented it in some home-care applications. The foreground segmentation achieved a high recognition rate. Our proposed was able to achieve real-time processing information on raspberry pi 3. This system can be extended to other smart home applications in the future. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that allows connection between devices using the internet to collect and exchange data with each other. Privacy and security have become the most pressing issues in the IoT network, especially in the smart home. Nevertheless, there are still many smart home devices that have not implemented security and privacy policies. This study proposes a remote sensor control system built on ESP32 to implement a smart home through the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) protocol by applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key. It addresses security issues in the smart home by encrypting messages sent from users to sensors. Besides ESP32, the system implementation also uses Raspberry Pi and smartphone with Android applications. The network was analyzed using Wireshark, and it showed that the message sent was encrypted. This implementation could prevent brute force attacks, with the result that it could guarantee the confidentiality of a message. Meanwhile, from several experiments conducted in this study, the difference in the average time of sending encrypted and unencrypted messages was not too significant, i.e., 20 ms. {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

abstract = {Security of the smart home environment network could be a significant problem for People with Disabilities specially during pandemic time. There are many IoT devices brought into their houses. Number of ads and distractions with them is just growing up. IoT device created to help PwD to feel more comfortable and easier to interact with the outer world (as an example visually impaired users). What if we make them trigger some tasks just with a simple voice command? This will allow PwD to become more independent to control the whole network. With the help of Alexa Echo device, Raspberry Pi, OpenDNS, and some networking configuration we could implement a comprehensive network control solution. Previous research gave us the idea that a small device like Raspberry Pi could be a good and cheap solution for that purpose. With the Pi4 release it got even more obvious to try using this device as main DNS server for the whole network. It will run in the background of the home environment controlling the whole traffic that goes through the router. Every device connected to the network however will be having the benefits of non-distracting and quicker internet. In addition, the feature of controlling the network with the simple voice command through Alexa device will be a handy additional functionality to PwD and whole network. In the future project this whole setup could be adjusted to prevent any malicious attack with the help of AI assistance and Machine learning algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {Smart home technology is gaining popularity among end-users, as it
allows them to remotely control a variety of devices in their homes.
Such systems have obvious benefits in terms of automation, but at the
same time pose significant threats to home owners if the underlying
communications are not secure. To this end, we introduce a novel
security protocol that simplifies the pairwise authentication and key
exchange among smart home devices. The protocol leverages identity-based
cryptography (IBC), thus relaxing the requirement for storing and
managing public key certificates. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks
associated with centralized key generation in IBC, we opt to generate
the private keys in a distributed manner, involving all smart devices.
We implemented our protocol on Raspberry Pi 3 devices and demonstrate
its efficiency in terms of both computational and communication cost.},

abstract = {Legacy-infrared (IR) devices are pervasively used. They are often
controlled by IR remotes and cannot be controlled over the Internet. A
trustworthy and cost-effective smart IR system that is able to change an
IR controllable device into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) device and
interconnect them for smart city/home applications is offered in this
article. First, a printed circuit board (PCB) consisting of an IR
receiver and multiple IR transmitters side by side which are capable of
transmitting about 20 m indoors is designed and implemented. This IR
transceiver board is the first of its kind. Second, the IR transceiver
can be linked up with a Raspberry Pi, for which we develop two software
tools, recording and replaying any IR signals so as to put the
corresponding IR device in control. Third, a smartphone can be connected
to the Pi by means of a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) cloud
server so that the commands can be sent by the smartphone to the legacy
IR device over the Internet. We have also identified the deficiency of
TLS mutual authentication implemented by the popular MQTT open-source
package Mosquitto for a trustworthy IoT system and patched the system.
We analyze the factors that affect the IR signal transmission distance,
discuss the security concerns of our IR transceiver, and illustrate the
scenarios for attacks. For instance, TV can be turned off remotely by a
drone equipped with the transceiver.},
