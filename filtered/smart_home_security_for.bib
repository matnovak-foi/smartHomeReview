detect the moment near the doors by this Raspberry pi triggers and
capture the image by using pi camera and compare that picture with the
already stored picture in the database if both are same then only it
will open the door else it will send the mail or SMS to the owner and
inform about the intruder at his/her home. The system doesn't allow
unauthenticated visitors to unlock the door. The owner can give
authentication to anyone by adding their image to the database. Through
this model we can avoid intruders and achieve the strongest security

Nowadays, IoTenabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and
tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in
IoT. Smart homes have been widely accepted by individuals and
organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security
systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of
home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user
to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that
ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home
security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like:
delay, non -web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of
alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the
home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security
systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to
the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other
latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home
more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence,
considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed
an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home
in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody
is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small
pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the
delay during process of e-mail alert. This paper also confirms the
advantage of Raspberry Pi flexibility and broad probability of its
usage. Preliminary analyses have shown encouraging results.},

Each connectivity opens the door to new possibilities to make a person's life easier and convenient. A smart home is one such area impacted by IoT which greatly improves a person's life by helping them create a secure environment for his family and carry out his day-to-day activities with ease. Focusing primarily in the context of Nepal where available smart systems are either expensive or lack basic features, this paper essentially deals with the design and implementation of a cost-efficient smart home system focusing on remote surveillance, monitoring different aspects (movement detections, surveillance and temperature and humidity) of a home with notification alerts. Furthermore, the system also aims to reduce electricity usage and minimize energy consumption by helping a person automate their everyday tasks such as turning on/off lights, thermostats, etc. by detecting their presence. Raspberry Pi is the heart of the home system managing all of these services. In addition, Amazon Cloud Services, Simple Email Service (SES) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) are used for notifying users/home-owners.

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems related to the operation of smart
microgrids is the optimal home energy management scheme with multiple
and conflicting objectives. Moreover, there is a noticeable increase in
homes equipped with renewable energy sources (RESs), where the
coordination of loads and generation can achieve extra savings and
minimize peak loads. In this paper, a solar-powered smart home with
optimal energy management is designed in an affordable and secure
manner, allowing the owner to control the home from remote and local
sites using their smartphones and PCs. The Raspberry Pi 4 B is used as
the brain of the proposed smart home automation management system
(HAMS). It is used to collect the data from the existing sensors and
store them, and then take the decision. The home is monitored using a
graphical interface that monitors room temperature, humidity, smoke, and
lighting through a set of sensors, as well as PIR sensors to monitor the
people movement. This action enables remote control of all home
appliances in a safe and emission-free manner. This target is reached
using Cayenne, which is an IoT platform, in addition to building some
codes related to some appliances and sensors not supported in Cayenne
from scratch. Convenience for people with disabilities is considered by
using the Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa) to control home appliances and the
charging point by voice, implementing the associated code for connecting
the Raspberry pi with Alexa from scratch, and simulating the system on
LabVIEW. To reach the optimal operation and reduce the operating costs,
an optimization framework for the home energy management system (HEMS)
is proposed. The operating costs for the day amounted to approximately
16.039 euro. There is a decrease in the operating costs by about
23.13{\%}. The consumption decreased after using the smart HAMS by 18.161
kWh. The results of the optimization also show that the least area that
can be used to install solar panels to produce the desired energy with
the lowest cost is about 118.1039 m(2), which is about 23.62{\%} of the
total surface area of the home in which the study was conducted. The
obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms
of automation, security, safety, and low operating costs.},

Studies show that homes without security systems are more likely to be targeted by burglars than those with professionally monitored systems. Security systems are often the first line of defense against break-ins. Today, due to the advancements in technology and in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to envision pervasive connectivity, storage and automation in systems. This paper focuses on designing and developing a model of an IoT-Based security system for homes, banks and offices in need of security. The proposed system has provision for theft and fire detection and sends alerts to the user through a text message. It also captures a number of snapshots of the intruder and mails it to the user. When compared to the other existing systems, the leverage obtained by preferring this system is that the user receives alerts irrespective of his location and whether or not he is connected to the internet or not. This system also consumes less power as the camera is activated and takes snapshots only in the presence of an intruder, unlike the CCTV system, where live feed is recorded round the clock. This system not only notifies the user but also the neighbor so that immediate action could be taken. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {An emerging technology that makes the world smarter is the Internet of
Things (IoT). The growth of the IoT network has enriched the home and
lifestyle with its associated technologies. Life today revolves around
the notion of automation and the items that are automated are said to be
of the next generation because they decrease human intervention. The
technology of the home automation system is unique to other systems that
allow the user to control the system through an internet connection from
any location around the world. The proposed work reflects the many IoT
applications that use Raspberry pi, sensors, IoT module to design the
smart home automation and home security monitoring framework. The smart
home automation system uses an android smartphone to easily control home
appliances from any location around the world through an internet
connection and will act as a smart monitoring security module for home
security monitoring. Traditional surveillance systems only record
motion-based movements, but the proposed system serves the function of
facial recognition to minimize the error caused by motion detection, and
since it records automatically only during motion detection, the system
saves a lot of storage space. Once the motion is detected by the PIR
Sensor and the image is sent to the Android app via Raspberry pi, the
Raspberry pi camera module is used to capture photos. This device can
track when motion is detected and scans for the faces caught in the
picture and operates with the aid of the door for face recognition. The
key benefit is that the owner can seek surveillance from any part of the
globe and can take action according to the circumstances.},

This paper envisions a smart home based on the two independent and emerging technologies viz face recognition, for the security purposes, and speech recognition, for the automation purposes. Moreover, the latest work done is discussed briefly and why an offline system was an urgent need to fill the gap in the recent technology protocols introduced in the related field. Security system ensures the working of the smart home by taking the image on the ringing of the bell and comparing it with the stored database of owners in a robust and reliable manner through Raspberry Pi microcontroller and OpenCV. Voice control over the whole house makes this system effective and efficient which could turn out to be a great charity to handicapped, elder and paralyzed people in the remote areas with no access to internet by a single voice command in the mic connected to Arduino V3 module. {\textcopyright} 2019 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the rapid development and maturity of the smart industry, smart home security systems are becoming popular. However, problems such as poor optimization under face recognition integration and high latency of smart home gesture recognition control still exist. In this paper, in response to the problems raised above, the more mature CNN algorithm and OT prime tracking algorithm are used for face recognition, and the Euclidean distance is introduced as the adjustable threshold for face recognition, and its recognition response time is 29-30ms; in gesture recognition, the mathematical model of finger angle recognition is used for gesture recognition, based on the Mediapipe open source framework, and in the experiment, its recognition time tends to be 60-100 frames, with an average response time of 61.75ms. These advances in facial and gesture recognition in home security systems provide faster and more accurate recognition, thereby enhancing the owner 's safety measures.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) provides the opportunity for remote sensing in a smart home. This can benefit home security. A case study was devised to remotely sense, inform and actuate. The study developed a surveillance system using Raspberry Pi and camera to detect and recognize a door caller's face from a live video stream and compare with an existing dataset to verify whether the person was authorized. If not authorized, the remote homeowner can be alerted via an email complete with an image of the caller. Automated and user actions can be performed depending on the type of visitor. RaspController, Google Assistant and VNC were used for actuation, to perform actions like playing random music, triggering voice conversations or turning on an alarm. The recognition system was developed in Python using OpenCV and face recognition, using pre trained models for Hog detection and Haar Cascade classification. The accuracy of the detection was 66.7{\%} for a small cohort of seven authorized people and an unauthorized class of five people. For actuation, interoperability with many smart home devices can be controlled from the smart home network, but with only limited functionality from a remote network. {\textcopyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Face recognition system is broadly used for human identification because of its capacity to measure the facial points and recognize the identity in an unobtrusive way. The application of face recognition systems can be applied to surveillance at home, workplaces, and campuses, accordingly. The problem with existing face recognition systems is that they either rely on the facial key points and landmarks or the face embeddings from FaceNet for the recognition process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical network (HN) framework which uses pre-trained architecture for recognizing faces followed by the validation from face embeddings using FaceNet. We also designed a real-time face recognition security door lock system connected with raspberry pi as an implication of the proposed method. The evaluation of the proposed work has been conducted on the dataset collected from 12 students from Faculty of Engineering and Technology, University of Sindh. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results over existing works. We also carried out a comparison on random faces acquired from the Internet to perform face recognition and results shows that the proposed HN framework is resilient to the randomly acquired faces. {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the past, securing valuables in our home/office has been a big chore. There is a high probability of any theft during our absence. When such incidents take place, it is often the case that we seek the help of the police and even sometimes we are unable to recover our belongings. One of the most effective ways to address this issue is to inform the homeowner of any burglary. The homeowners can safeguard their valuables if such information is available in time. The purpose of this work is to inform the home owner about any such untoward incident occurs. That is when their secret locker is broken or when any next person tries to look at it, then our proposed solution will intimate the homeowner with relevant information. IoT-based heist detector is to build a smart security system that could be accommodated by all level of peoples by means of cost, low power consumption, and easy implementation. This work covers both hardware (Raspberry Pi) and software parts. The hardware part includes GSM module, camera module, magnetic switch, etc. The proposed solution is connected with an android application (telegram) that helps to receive the captured image and short message service on the incident. So that homeowner can take decision accordingly. The GSM module in the proposed system sends messages and calls to the various mobile numbers as provided by the admin so that there could be very less chances to miss the calls or messages. Since most of the theft could be happening at midnight, most of the people's phone would be in silent/do not disturb mode so that the system enable us to set such timings, and it automatically rings when it receives call from the GSM. Many security systems have been developed to monitor and secure our property but some of them have very complicated connectivity and their implementation cost is high. This system starts working when the connection between the sensors mounted on the door is disconnected. The test results shows that the proposed IoT-based real-time system outperforms the existing security system in terms of cost, performance, and its unique features. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract = {Technology has changed the world. There is a huge growth in technology connected to almost every field. The pace and diversity of advancement is very rapid. Hence, new technology and techniques are coming up and are put to use as per the need. In such advanced scenario, providing security to home has also become a major point of concern. Presently security cameras can be used for the same. But such cameras may be visible to intruders and there is possibility that cameras may be damaged. Hence, in order to serve the purpose, there is a need to find an alternative secure, accurate and quick method. Hence, an effort is made in this paper to design a home security system using Raspberry Pi. System requires Raspberry Pi, Camera, Touch screen and android mobile as hardware components. Python, Node.js and OpenCV libraries are used for software coding. Usually most of the intrusion detection systems click the photo of intruders as soon as the human is detected. But, such systems fail to click photos, so that the intruder can be identified (Face View Photo) and visible. In proposed system, a proper illustrative method is proposed so that the intrusion detection is accurate and photos thus captured are clear, so that intruder is clearly visible. The proposed system is designed as a smart mirror which will provide both information and home security. The system is developed to accept touch and mobile commands. As soon as the intrusion is detected, an alert message along with the identifiable and clear photo (Face view) of intruder will be sent to the owner's/administrator's mobile. The mirror owner can also see the video of deployed environment through the camera fitted on smart mirror. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Westernization of today's society has led to the increase in the number of small families while the gradual spread of living into the suburban areas has raised a significant concern in the security of the individuals. Although there are many security systems available in the market today, they are mostly expensive. The objective of the model described in this paper is to present a simple and low-cost design to make our homes smarter and safer. The Raspberry pi based framework built in this project comprises of PIR sensor, IR sensor, Piezoelectric sensor and Sound sensor which not only alerts an intruder action but also captures the images and recordings through a camera from the scene. An intrusion can be identified with the help of the above mentioned sensors that can detect the presence of a person, temperature variations and sound at the location. In case of a deviant output from the above measurements, the owner of the house is immediately alerted through IoT. The rightful person receives a message on his phone immediately followed by images of the person causing the sceptical situation along with a captured video that gives a detailed picture of the happenings and will also serve as an evidence for further investigations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a smart and robust home security system. This is for intrusion detection along with a proprietary Android application. Intruder-Spi makes use of relatively low cost but effective wireless sensors network that makes it an affordable security system to buy when compared to other expensive CCTV camera systems. This implements a home security automated intrusion detection system which alerts the host using ‘Twilio' API. The detection system comprises of a laser tripwire. The android application has been developed using the Python programming language on the server side and Java is being used to develop the application on the client side. The system notifies the user about any possible theft or intrusion in one's environment by clicking pictures and recording a video for a period using a proprietary Raspberry Pi camera and storing it into the MySQL database in the Raspberry Pi itself. Apache2 is the web-server being used on the Pi to serve client requests being made from the Android device which will eventually show the respective captured images and videos to the registered users who can then control the application remotely. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Nowadays home automation is used increasingly with the help of Smartly controlling home devices. With the plenty of manufacturers and the latest technologies, the usage of home automation is up to the mark. Firstly, from a social point of view, human care is very essential for physically challenged and elderly people. Secondly, it is implemented using a single Raspberry Pi controller. The controller controls and monitors many home appliances that are interconnected to form a home network. For example, the home appliances such as lights, Fans, temperature and humidity sensors, gas leakage detectors, smoke detectors, and fire detectors can be controlled by a single controller. It also includes the establishment of security and emergency alert systems in case of an emergency. So, this leads to an idea to develop a smart home controlling system for physically challenged people. The system developed must be low cost, low power consumption, cheaper, cost-effective, flexible and it should be user-friendly interface, same as the usage of the remote control of various electronic gadgets in our day-to-day life. It should be designed as user-friendly, so that the person can use it very easily and effectively same as, other hand-held devices. In this paper, a smartly controlling system was developed especially for physically challenged and elderly people. This was done by integrating Raspberry Pi and various sensors into the web applications. To design this system, a Raspberry Pi module along with a voice control technique is used. The output of this system is to control home appliances. All the home appliances are simply controlled by connecting through a monitor built on the internet. Raspberry Pi is used to operate and controls the motion sensors and voice recognition for controlling the home appliance through human voice to provide the smart home. It is a very simple technique that was very much helpful to helpless people. {\textcopyright} 2022 Author(s).},

Along with the development of internet technology, social media is getting cheaper than conventional telephones. Based on the emergence of social media applications that replace the current telephone function, and the importance of a home security system that can provide home security information remotely, this study aims to design a home security notification system using the Telegram social media application and single board computer devices. The system prototype was built using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method with tools and materials such as motion sensor components and sound sensors as detectors, processing components using a single board computer type Raspberry Pi and output components such as buzzer alarms and internet modems. The test method uses a box house simulation construction. Motion detection testing is done by simulating the hand movements in the box. While the sound detection test is carried out by giving a hand sound on the inside of the box house. From the two tests, the system detects motion and sound then activates an alarm, and simultaneously sends home security notifications to users via the Telegram social media application. {\textcopyright} 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

costs reasons, as well as COVID-19. Motivated by these drivers, this
paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a reference architecture
called Imtidad that provides Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) as
a Service (DAIaaS) over cloud, fog, and edge using a service catalog
case study containing 22 AI skin disease diagnosis services. These
services belong to four service classes that are distinguished based on
software platforms (containerized gRPC, gRPC, Android, and Android
Nearby) and are executed on a range of hardware platforms (Google Cloud,
HP Pavilion Laptop, NVIDIA Jetson nano, Raspberry Pi Model B, Samsung
Galaxy S9, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4) and four network types (Fiber,
Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth). The AI models for the diagnosis include
two standard Deep Neural Networks and two Tiny AI deep models to enable
their execution at the edge, trained and tested using 10,015 real-life
dermatoscopic images. The services are evaluated using several
benchmarks including model service value, response time, energy
consumption, and network transfer time. A DL service on a local
smartphone provides the best service in terms of both energy and speed,
followed by a Raspberry Pi edge device and a laptop in fog. The services
are designed to enable different use cases, such as patient diagnosis at
home or sending diagnosis requests to travelling medical professionals
through a fog device or cloud. This is the pioneering work that provides
a reference architecture and such a detailed implementation and
treatment of DAIaaS services, and is also expected to have an extensive
impact on developing smart distributed service infrastructures for
healthcare and other sectors.},

Home automation makes life easier by providing control of all home appliances at one point, which is basically by a smartphone. The need for surveillance is rapidly increasing in domestic and commercial applications due to its low cost and ease of deployment. To ensure the security of video surveillance of personal homes and small businesses, people resort to third-party organizations with expensive equipment. In turn, the solution for providing a video surveillance security system based on a Rasp berry Pi single-board computer using HomeAssistant software is more profitable and easier to implement. The choice fell on the HomeAssistant software, since HomeAssistant is an open source application and does not require additional costs.

Face recognition powered by IoT is becoming more popular because it is dependable and simple to use. To prevent algorithmic errors and produce enhanced accuracy than existing systems, our system employs a facial recognition door lock with the integration of three algorithms on a single camera. The system detects unauthorized people near the entrance and notifies the user via a mobile app. For hardware communication, we used a camera module, a Raspberry PI, passive infrared motion sensors, and wireless internet access. The Python and OpenCV libraries are used in the algorithm's development. When the motion sensor detects activity in front of the door, the camera is activated, and the system gathers camera feeds and sends the images to three algorithms for analysis. If any two or all of the algorithm's results match the image in the database, the door unlocks; otherwise, it remains locked. The development of this system aims to enhance accuracy by combining three algorithms and to provide consumers with data about what is happening in front of their home via a smart door lock system. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) with deep learning (DL) is drastically growing
and plays a significant role in many applications, including medical and
healthcare systems. It can help users in this field get an advantage in
terms of enhanced touchless authentication, especially in spreading
infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even
though there is a number of available security systems, they suffer from
one or more of issues, such as identity fraud, loss of keys and
passwords, or spreading diseases through touch authentication tools. To
overcome these issues, IoT-based intelligent control medical
authentication systems using DL models are proposed to enhance the
security factor of medical and healthcare places effectively. This work
applies IoT with DL models to recognize human faces for authentication
in smart control medical systems. We use Raspberry Pi (RPi) because it
has low cost and acts as the main controller in this system. The
installation of a smart control system using general-purpose
input/output (GPIO) pins of RPi also enhanced the antitheft for smart
locks, and the RPi is connected to smart doors. For user authentication,
a camera module is used to capture the face image and compare them with
database images for getting access. The proposed approach performs face
detection using the Haar cascade techniques, while for face recognition,
the system comprises the following steps. The first step is the facial
feature extraction step, which is done using the pretrained CNN models
(ResNet-50 and VGG-16) along with linear binary pattern histogram (LBPH)
algorithm. The second step is the classification step which can be done
using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Only classified face as
genuine leads to unlock the door; otherwise, the door is locked, and the
system sends a notification email to the home/medical place with
detected face images and stores the detected person name and time
information on the SQL database. The comparative study of this work
shows that the approach achieved 99.56{\%} accuracy compared with some
different related methods.},

home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the
Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we
will provide the cloud server for smart homes' to store the homes' data
due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for
various application's service providers and analysis. In the proposed
smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee
communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP
camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for
web-based controlling. We aim to reduce the human intervention, secure

abstract = {Urban households have better security options compared to rural
households. Closed-Circuited Television (CCTV) is a surveillance tool
designed to assist in monitoring events. However, the passive monitoring
feature of CCTV does not provide any feedback nor respond to the user
when a crime incident arises. Thus, a low-cost intruder system with
Raspberry Pi which adopts a similar feature and functionality for a home
security system is proposed. This is by integrating the feature of the
OpenCV library to the Pi Camera to enhance the overall functionality.
The use of sensors like a magnetic switch for door and PIR sensors allow
the home security system to take in feedback regarding the environment.
This will serve as a security layer or enhancement for the home security
measurements. The proposed system will help to remedy the passive

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that involves connecting the
virtual world of the Internet to the real world through so-called smart
objects. Indeed, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively
employed in a wide range of applications, including healthcare field and
home automation. These objects are equipped with communication
capabilities and can exchange data over the Internet. In recent times,
the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge of growth and
transformation. The integration of IoT-enabled devices has
revolutionized remote monitoring in healthcare, empowering healthcare
providers to keep their patients safe and healthy while delivering
exceptional care. On the other hand, the home automation system is
becoming increasingly popular due to its many benefits, which involve
remotely monitoring and controlling household appliances. In fact, the
main challenges faced by home automation systems are poor manageability,
rigidity, difficulty in achieving security, and high ownership costs. As
the internet and its applications continue to grow, there is enormous
potential for remotely accessing, controlling and monitoring
network-enabled devices. With this context in mind, the objective of
this project is to develop two IoT-based models. These models are based
on Arduino and Raspberry pi boards, cloud, Bluetooth and ZigBee
protocols. The first model is an IoT healthcare system that employs
various sensors to collect heart rate and motion data. The second model
is a home automation system that utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure
temperature and humidity levels, a MQ2 sensor to detect gas leaks, and
an ultrasonic sensor to control the garage door's opening and closing.
Both systems are built around an Arduino or a Raspberry pi
microcontrollers integrated with an Android mobile application to
process and transmit data via Bluetooth or Zigbee ensuring that the
mobile app receives real-time updates.},

In recent days when ever house is locked the break-ins number has been increased enormously. So in order to provide security to the home this presented paper is helpful. When the intruders enters into the house, image of the intruder is captured by the system, even if intruder escapes Police need to caught the intruder to recover the stolen things which needs the picture of the intruder to the police. The planned system captures the picture of the intruder and sends it to the authorized mail through internet over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). So security to the home is provided more effectively in the smart way of communicating the things. Home appliances are smartly automated to reduce the human effort for intelligent decisions with the help of Internet Of Things (IoT). This compact and lightweight product is designed to provide security and to control home appliances in the house by the owner through IoT servers.

The system also includes a web-based remote monitoring, an authentication module, and a bare-bones embedded IoT server, which transmits the live pictures of the visitors via email along with an SMS notification, and the owner can then remotely control the lock by responding to the email with predefined security codes to unlock the door. This system finds wide applications in smart homes where the physical presence of the owner at all times is not possible, and where a remote authentication and control is desired. The system has been implemented and tested using the Raspberry Pi 2 board, Python along with OpenCV are used to program the various face recognition and control modules. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract = {Security in home is now being directed from traditional methodologies to automation with the help of Internet. The Internet of things is the network of interconnecting devices (may be physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc.) embedded with electronics, sensors, etc., to exchange data. Nowadays, home systems are equipped with computing and information technology which provides them with smartness and intellect. Since doors are the gateway to our homes, therefore it is necessary to make them more secure. Currently available mechanism of providing secure access to doors includes bare-metal locks and some smart locking systems. The smart locking system's performance can be evaluated on the basis of identification accuracy, intrusiveness, and cost. In this paper, we introduce the idea to provide secure access to home. It will be achieved through smart doorbell which is a cost-effective alternative to currently its counterparts. Our system connects WiFi-enabled Android devices with firebase server using Raspberry Pi and enables user to answer the door when the doorbell is pressed. It learns to identify new user by using face recognition as a unique identity to authenticate the individual. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract = {Before the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), the involvement of manpower was more involved in providing security to the home. Even with the right involvement of manpower, it is difficult to identify unusual events like fire accidents, gas leakage, and motion or presence of an intruder. The Internet of Things is a technology in which all devices communicate with each other through the internet. This technology can be used in our home security systems in an effective manner. Many existing systems failed to meet some challenging issues like multi-sensing operations, delay in alerts and non-continuous monitoring due to power breakdowns. In this paper, we developed an IoT-based smart security alert system which is used to send alerts to the owner through SMS and email whenever there is an intruder or other harmful activities are taking place at the home. This system mainly consists of Raspberry Pi-3, Pi camera, power shifting circuit, gas sensor, fire sensor, IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, GSM module, Buzzer and mobile. In the proposed system, whenever any intruder is detected the system will capture an image and alert the user by sending SMS and email to the user. It also provides security regarding fire and smoke by sending SMS to the user. Our proposed system is also equipped with a power shifter circuit which provides continuous supply to the circuit for continuous monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

abstract = {Smart surveillance systems are used to monitor specific areas, such as
homes, buildings, and borders, and these systems can effectively detect
any threats. In this work, we investigate the design of low-cost
multiunit surveillance systems that can control numerous surveillance
cameras to track multiple objects (i.e., people, cars, and guns) and
promptly detect human activity in real time using low computational
systems, such as compact or single board computers. Deep learning
techniques are employed to detect certain objects to surveil
homes/buildings and recognize suspicious and vital events to ensure that
the system can alarm officers of relevant events, such as stranger
intrusions, the presence of guns, suspicious movements, and identified
fugitives. The proposed model is tested on two computational systems,
specifically, a single board computer (Raspberry Pi) with the Raspbian
OS and a compact computer (Intel NUC) with the Windows OS. In both
systems, we employ components, such as a camera to stream real-time
video and an ultrasonic sensor to alarm personnel of threats when
movement is detected in restricted areas or near walls. The system
program is coded in Python, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is
used to perform recognition. The program is optimized by using a
foreground object detection algorithm to improve recognition in terms of
both accuracy and speed. The saliency algorithm is used to slice certain
required objects from scenes, such as humans, cars, and airplanes. In
this regard, two saliency algorithms, based on local and global patch
saliency detection are considered. We develop a system that combines two
saliency approaches and recognizes the features extracted using these
saliency techniques with a conventional neural network. The field
results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection, ranging
between 34{\%} and 99.9{\%} for different situations. The low percentage is
related to the presence of unclear objects or activities that are
different from those involving humans. However, even in the case of low
accuracy, recognition and threat identification are performed with an
accuracy of 100{\%} in approximately 0.7 s, even when using computer
systems with relatively weak hardware specifications, such as a single
board computer (Raspberry Pi). These results prove that the proposed
system can be practically used to design a low-cost and intelligent
security and tracking system.},

abstract = {A smart door system which can be controlled by the android application installed on smart phone is proposed in this paper. Earlier, smart locks were used which enhanced the security features of the house. The proposed model can eliminate the concept of lock system as here the security is provided to the door itself. This would result in a safe and secure door with no locks! Controlling the movement of the door is enabled by Raspberry pi and its related embedded software. Also merging IOT with android is has many advantages in terms of security. The motion sensors are used to detect any movement in front of the door. If any person comes in front of the door, a motion is triggered; the image is captured and notified to the owner. Thus in overall proposed system, two technologies are concentrated on, one is motion sensing in the front of the door in real time even if there is no one at home and the second is to control the movement of the door by the smart phone. Thus by connecting a mobile phone to a door, the owner get notified whenever any visitor visits his home and looking up to the images, the owner of the home can send the open door signal for only the trusted visitors. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

research area in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT's). The necessity

accidents, LPG gas leakage and fire detection etc, which all are
important aspects of a Home Security System. In this paper, a prototype
Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home (SSH) model is developed. Generally
a home security system uses signals in terms of alarm of intruder
detection. However, the proposed Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home
uses a mobile communication (GSM) based Home Security System, which
helps to provide a better security to have systems that can be globally
connected. In the proposed system a text message is sent, whenever an
event from any sensor is detected, so that immediate actions could be
taken by the home owner. The proposed SSH sends SMS using GSM-Module and
mail through Raspberry Pi micro-controller. The prototype SSH based
smart system also uses an Arduino micro-controller board for commands
processing and control. The system uses GSM technology, which provides
global access to the Smart Home Security System. The prototype SSH,
developed at a low cost, can be used for converting existing homes into
smart homes at relatively affordable cost and with convenience. The

In brief, Domotics allows users to monitor and control various devices/appliances within a smart home. From entertainment to security, several devices have become more accessible. However, the underlying network infrastructure in this environment has remained the same despite the recent revolution brought about by Software-Defined Networking (SDN).For the past decade, SDN has shown great potential for providing more network flexibility and programmability in both the control and data plane. However, most of the use cases are thought for enterprise and Data-Center Networks, while its application closer to the end-users (i.e., Home environments) is still under-exploited. Therefore, this research introduces the Network Operations for Domotics (NeO-Domotics) notion, which uses Next-Generation SDN components (e.g., P4, NG-SDN interfaces) in the context of Home Automation.

Recently, development has been done in this domain and few systems have been proposed that either use voice assistants or application for controlling the electrical appliances. However; less emphasis is laid on power efficiency and this system cannot be integrated with the existing appliances and hence, the entire system needs to be upgraded adding to a lot of additional cost in purchasing new appliances. In this research, the objective is to design such a system that emphasises on power efficiency as well as can be integrated with the already existing appliances. NodeMCU, along with Raspberry Pi, Firebase realtime database, is used to create a system that accomplishes such endeavours and can control relays, which can control these appliances without the need of replacing them. The experiments in this paper demonstrate triggering of electrical appliances using voice assistant, fire alarm on the basis of flame sensor and temperature sensor. Moreover; use of android application was presented for operating electrical appliances from a remote location.

abstract = {Nowadays, the care of elderly peoples is a significant problem and needs more time and attention from the caregivers. In the elderly population, accidental fall is a common cause of injury due to the weakness or any other disease such as high temperature and blood pressure. Moreover, in developing countries, the use of natural gas for older adults is widespread for room heating. The use of a gas heater in a room can be hazardous, especially at night and it has reportedly said to turn OFF the gas heater while going to sleep. However, it is ignored quite often that results in many deaths not only to the elderly but to all age groups. To cope with these issues and to provide a safer environment, especially to the older people where the caretaker can be informed well on-time, a raspberry Pi assisted cost-effective safety system is proposed. The 3-axis accelerometer of gas and flame sensors are used to detect an event when accidental fall occurs precisely, or any gas leakage or flame is detected. The caretaker will be informed using a mobile app or text alert to take action immediately. Results demonstrate that the modules for fall and gas/open flame detection accurately detected true events by 92{\%} and 95{\%} respectively.

abstract = {The unusual development of the “Web of Things (IoT)” is changing the world, and the quick decrease in the cost of normal IoT segments is enabling individuals to improve new ideas and items at home. The prominence of home computerization has expanded because of the ease and effortlessness through the availability of PDAs and tablets and other savvy gadgets. Keen homes can expand the solace and security of the occupant through, for instance, interfaces to control light, temperature or distinctive electronic gadgets. The administration of vitality assets is a vital issue for keen homes. It is in this manner conceivable to put the warmers on reserve when the occupants are missing or to naturally adjust the utilization of the electrical assets as per the necessities of the inhabitants with the end goal to lessen the squandering of the vitality assets. What's more, another fundamental objective of the use of data innovation to families is the security of people. This is conceivable through frameworks that can envision risky circumstances or respond to occasions that jeopardize the trustworthiness of individuals. The present work plans a shrewd and secure framework dependent on various sensors and Raspberry Pi by means of the Internet of Things (IoT). {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is internet computing devices that are connected to everyday objects that can receive and transmit data intelligently. IoTs allow humans to interact and control everyday objects wirelessly to provide more convenience in their lifestyle. The Raspberry Pi is a small, lightweight, and cheap single-board computer that can fit on a human's palm. Security plays a big role in a home. People concern about security by preventing any intruders to enter their home property. Therefore, a smart surveillance monitoring system is proposed to solve this problem by detecting intruders and capturing the images of the intruder. Notifications will also be sent to the user immediately when motions are detected. This smart surveillance monitoring system only stores the images of the intruders that triggered the motion sensor, making this system use significantly less storage space. The proposed Raspberry Pi is connected with a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, a webcam, and an internet connection, the whole device can be configured to carry out the surveillance tasks. The objectives of this project are to design, implement and test the surveillance system using the Raspberry Pi. This proposed surveillance system provides the user with a live stream of the video feed for the user. Whenever a motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, the web camera may capture an image of the intruder and alert the users (owners) through email notifications. {\textcopyright} 2023 Author(s).},

such situations, identifying a visitor and getting remote access to
their home is indispensable. A smart door lock which can be completely
monitored and controlled from a remote location using an android
application on a smartphone is proposed in this paper. When a visitor
presses a calling bell/push button at the door, a Raspberry Pi with HD
camera gets powered up and notifies the owner with a message and streams
visitors' live identity on owner's mobile over the Internet. The owner,
based on his willingness, can easily open/close the door remotely by
entering a password that was preset. In addition, he can also convey an
audio message to the visitor by entering the corresponding text in his
smartphone app. The proof of concept provided in this paper emphasizes
the real-time remote accessibility in the owner's hand (smartphone) on

It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-Automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others. The main purpose of our paper is to build a perfect smart home-helper for the users to operate the home appliances easily through voice commands. {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

nowadays. In home and working areas, people will be engaged with too
many activities. Sometimes, there might be a chance to forget to turn
off various electrical appliances like lights, fans, servers, if there
were nobody in the room or area/passage. This leads to huge power
consumption. Also, it is very difficult to physically challenged persons
and old-age people to access the appliances every time manually. To
avoid all such situations, we proposed ``Smart Home System.{\{}''{\}} It is
the process of automating home appliances in which the various electric
and electronic appliances are wired up to a central computer control
system so they can be handled more efficiently. ``Smart Home{\{}''{\}} helps
to overcome the problems that usually people face in daily life. Behind
this, it needs the involvement of multiple complex hardware components
in controlling the smart home project and there is a fair amount of
software architecture that is responsible for driving the hardware
components. Moreover, there is a need to employ persons to monitor such
simple tasks. This manual approach is time-consuming and also very
costly. Thus, automation is the better alternative through which these
tasks can be completed automatically without human effort and also
accessed remotely from anywhere and anytime with less effort. Everyone
is showing interest in making their home smarter to ease their daily
activities. The proposed Smart Home system has the capability to control
the home appliances based on the environment. Here, different boards
like Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino UNO are going to be deployed which can
take control over the appliances and act accordingly. People can also be
notified, if there are any fire/gas leakages inside the home. This
security system facilitates the user to take necessary actions as soon
as possible to secure their home. It also involves the deployment of
different kinds of sensors which can able to detect the object motion,
temperature and humidity and fire detection. This application is very
simple and can be implemented in all types of homes.},

abstract = {Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for IoT-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of a sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as PIR (Passive Infra-red) sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out architecture for a cost effective “smart” door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller (MCU) board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other RF (Radio Frequency) devices. {\textcopyright} 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract = {In this project based on Smart Home Security, we make the home homelier by connecting members of a residence to it by creating a network between the residents and the home. Using the concept of internet of things and networking, we make sure that the people not only lead a more comfortable life, but a more secure one as well. In this paper we take the concept of smart home systems and add additional security features to the concept to make living safe and secure along with comfortable and cozy. Using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, our system alerts the user when an unknown person is detected within the household so that they can take the required steps needed in case it is an unwanted intruder. In the modern, fast paced world we live in, where security threats grow in large numbers each day, the need for home security increases with the same intensity. A smarter, more efficient and a more convenient approach towards home security ensures an increase in the number of people having access to such systems as well as makes sure of a decrease in the number of people having difficulty with confusing and complex security interfaces. This project turns your mundane everyday object into defenders of your home, eliminating the need to bring in any other expensive security devices. Additionally, it also lets you keep a track of your entire household objects in one place. {\textcopyright} BEIESP.},

abstract = {Empirical studies suggest that environment is the main factor influencing crime patterns so that closed circuit television (CCTV) becomes the choice to reduce the risk of crime. However, CCTV is less effective because it requires high bandwidth {\&} storage and cannot provide notifications. Therefore, a technology called the Internet of Things (IoT) appears so that CCTV or webcam can work together with sensors to detect the presence of intruders and provide notifications. This study proposes a system that detects intruders and sends notifications to homeowner regardless of time and place. This system is usually referred to as a smart home security system. The authors proposed the smart home security system for intruder detection using YOLO V3 algorithm. This research is implemented using magnetic door sensor and alarm or buzzer and a webcam connected to Raspberry Pi 3B+. This proposed system will send notifications using telegram. We have implemented the proposed system and found the result that most accurate intruder detector is the YOLO V3 algorithm with an accuracy of 98.58{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2023, ICIC International.

security through which you can decide who can enter your home using your
smartphone and web application. It's also made it simple and relatively
affordable to monitor your home anytime and anywhere. the key issue in a
traditional home security system is, it is easily breakable and quite
outdated. This in turns, results in the robbery and also needs
installation of the costly security system. To tackle this problem, we
propose a smart home security system, which is IoT as well as face
recognition enabled. In our system, the web camera is used which is
connected to the raspberry pi accompanied by sensors such as Passive
Infrared(Pir) and Ultrasonic sensor. On motion detection camera captures
an image of the person in front of the door then real-time face
recognition is done using local binary pattern (LBP). If person's image
matches with one of the home members then the door will unlock, else
doorbell will ring. if an intruder tries to break door then an alarm
will be raised at the same time SMS and Email containing image of the
intruder will be sent to the homeowner. Face recognition works well in
multi-face recognition and stranger identification, which meet the
requirement of home security. This system is battery powered in case of
power failure. Furthermore, the house owner can keep track of activity
happening in the house using android and web application connected to
the raspberry pi using the internet. Using Android application or web
application owner can also add new person's faces into the databases

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoTs) are internet computing devices which are connected to everyday objects that can receive and transmit data intelligently. IoTs allow human to interact and control everyday objects wirelessly to provide more convenience in their lifestyle. The Raspberry Pi is a small, lightweight and cheap single board computer that can fit on human's palm. Security plays a big role in a home. People concern about security by preventing any intruders to enter their home. This is to prevent loss of privacy and assets. The closed-circuit television (CCTV) is one of the device used to monitor the secured area for any intruders. The use of traditional CCTV to monitor the secured area have three limitations, which are requiring a huge volume of storage to store all the videos regardless there are intruders or not, does not notify the users immediately when there are motions detected, and users must always check the CCTV recorded videos regularly to identity any intruders. Therefore, a smart surveillance monitoring system is proposed to solve this problem by detecting intruders and capturing image of the intruder. Notifications will also be sent to the user immediately when motions are detected. This smart surveillance monitoring system only store the images of the intruders that triggered the motion sensor, making this system uses significantly less storage space. The proposed Raspberry Pi is connected with a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, a webcam and internet connection, the whole device can be configured to carry out the surveillance tasks. The objectives of this project are to design, implement and test the surveillance system using the Raspberry Pi. This proposed surveillance system provides the user with live stream of video feed for the user. Whenever a motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, the web camera may capture an image of the intruder and alert the users (owners) through Short Message Service (SMS) and email notifications. The methodology used to develop this system is by using the object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) model. {\textcopyright} 2018, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During the last decade the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) based
applications inspired the world by providing state of the art solutions
to many common problems. From traffic management systems to urban cities
planning and development, IoT based home monitoring systems, and many
other smart applications. Regardless of these facilities, most of these
IoT based solutions are data driven and results in small accuracy values
for smaller datasets. In order to address this problem, this paper
presents deep learning based hybrid approach for the development of an
IoT-based intelligent home security and appliance control system in the
smart cities. This hybrid model consists of; convolution neural network
and binary long short term model for the object detection to ensure
safety of the homes while IoT based hardware components like; Raspberry
Pi, Amazon Web services cloud, and GSM modems for remotely accessing and
controlling of the home appliances. An android application is developed
and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud for the remote
monitoring of home appliances. A GSM device and Message queuing
telemetry transport (MQTT) are integrated for communicating with the
connected IoT devices to ensure the online and offline communication.
For object detection purposes a camera is connected to Raspberry Pi
using the proposed hybrid neural network model. The applicability of the
proposed model is tested by calculating results for the object at
varying distance from the camera and for different intensity levels of
the light. Besides many applications the proposed model promises for
providing optimum results for the small amount of data and results in

abstract = {In the present world the security of the home, banks, shops, etc., are the prime concerns. The traditional security such as Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras are very easy to break and lead to theft. And moreover, the installation cost of the security systems is costlier. To overcome these problems, we are presenting Internet of Things (IoT) based solution where we can setup a smart security system. In this paper, we are proposing the system with the help of face detection and face recognition algorithms to secure our home which gives us the facility of entire surveillance of our buildings remotely and take appropriate action if anything goes wrong. The Camera Serial Interface (CSI) is attached to the Raspberry PI which detects presence of person using Face detection and recognition algorithms. The multiple Raspberry PIs attached in different areas of our buildings are connected to the main Raspberry PI which acts as hub module. If the person is identified as unknown, the information is sent to Hub module which in turn sends the alert message and live video streaming to the user using an app which we developed. {\textcopyright} 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract = {In today's world, where everyone wants to keep their valuables safe and
secure, video surveillance for observing a particular area has become
the need of the hour. To address this problem, we have come up with a
solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank
vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places,
it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This
wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the
footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor.
Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video
cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and
records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras
will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information
and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming
is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs.
Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is
impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based
background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background
Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room
where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send
an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to
identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and
securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using
blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security
from hackers.},

abstract = {This work is dedicated to the Smart Office and Smart Home design: a brief smart survey of the used protocols, platforms, and best practices under consideration of the following criteria like price factor, easy configuring and manageability, data security, and privacy aspects, as well as energy efficiency. The practical problems for IoT and IIoT components compatibility as well as cloud independence, are discussed too. The authors mostly favor open-source and cloud-free solutions for Smart Home and established commercial platforms for Smart Office with advanced security, as shown in the presented case studies. Blockchaining of IoT and IIoT contributes to the compulsoriness and commitment in the decentralized world of “smart things” at home and in office rooms. However, secured smart devices can only be achieved with the combination of known crypto-technologies. Through a step-by-step provision of different blockchain-based platforms, the declared protection goals can be reached. The main features of the functioning of IoT, Edge, and Cloud computing technologies are considered. An intelligent IoT system has been developed to collect data from a specific location and transmit it to an Edge device for on-site processing. This data will be transferred to the cloud system or further processing or remote management, if needed. The solution aims to reduce the cost of maintaining the system by reducing the volume of messages that are sent to the cloud platform, which is quite expensive and a weighty factor in using the system, to provide remote management without buying a fixed server part. An algorithm for predicting temperature values in the server room of a smart office has been proposed and implemented in a designed IoT system based on Raspberry Pi 4 using an LSTM model. Using this solution in practice will increase the reliability of server equipment by early prediction, warning, and taking measures in case of temperature rise. {\textcopyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Smart home applications are ubiquitous and have gained popularity due to
the overwhelming use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technology. The
revolution in technologies has made homes more convenient, efficient,
and even more secure. The need for advancement in smart home technology
is necessary due to the scarcity of intelligent home applications that
cater to several aspects of the home simultaneously, i.e., automation,
security, safety, and reducing energy consumption using less bandwidth,
computation, and cost. Our research work provides a solution to these
problems by deploying a smart home automation system with the
applications mentioned above over a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi
(RPI) device. The RPI is used as a central controlling unit, which
provides a cost-effective platform for interconnecting a variety of
devices and various sensors in a home via the Internet. We propose a
cost-effective integrated system for smart home based on IoT and
Edge-Computing paradigm. The proposed system provides remote and
automatic control to home appliances, ensuring security and safety.
Additionally, the proposed solution uses the edge-computing paradigm to
store sensitive data in a local cloud to preserve the customer's
privacy. Moreover, visual and scalar sensor-generated data are processed
and held over edge device (RPI) to reduce bandwidth, computation, and
storage cost. In the comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, the
proposed system is 5{\%} faster in detecting motion, and 5 ms and 4 ms in
switching relay on and off, respectively. It is also 6{\%} more efficient
than the existing solutions with respect to energy consumption.},

abstract = {Voice-based command recognition is commonly used in security systems, phones, household appliances and hardware designed for handicapped people. Most of the current research study the voice command recognition for the smart home in English. Lack of study for voice command recognition in Malay makes it challenging to apply the voice command services for the smart home in Malaysia. Also, voice recognition is a non-trivial task in natural language processing. This project is to identify the command used for smart home appliances using Malay and design the algorithm for this system. Then, the proposed algorithm will be deployed on a Raspberry Pi to see the performance of Malay command in accuracy and the suitability of the algorithm to be deployed on low cost embedded devices. Light, fan, and television had been chosen as electrical appliances to build the command. An algorithm that previously used to recognize songs, the robust quad algorithm, is used in this project for voice command recognition. The proposed method has two main processes, known as feature extraction and voice recognition. In the feature extraction process, the audio fingerprint will extract data from the command spectral peak. For voice recognition, audio fingerprint matching will be used to analyze the audio commands. The outcome of this project is when the voice command is given by the user by activate or deactivate the target home appliance. The second outcome is the background noise that affects the system is reduced by using robust quad algorithm and increase the accuracy of the system. The results of this project have shown that the proposed algorithm is suitable to be implemented on a Raspberry Pi and achieve a high recognition rate with 87{\%}. In the presence of noise with 15 dB, the proposed algorithm can maintain the high recognition rate with 82{\%}. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},
