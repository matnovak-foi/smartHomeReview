Earlier electronic devices were controlled through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee in the restricted areas, but with the help of advanced technologies like IoT and cloud, we can extend it to such a level where we can control the devices even from remote areas. Raspberry Pi is one such technology which made a strong influence to control any electronic devices even from the remote areas. The technology designed can expand in allowing multiplicity of devices that can be controlled and also at a very low cost. Usage of Raspberry Pi device on home automation and its benefits need to be observed. Ever-growing connected ecosystem provisioned the industry to change the way we interact with the traditional brick and mortar houses to such an extent that the user is entirely in control of his home’s comfort and security. For the useful utilization of power very effectively, certain human errors happening unintentionally need to be reduced, like to switch off home appliances; the home automation system has to be designed in such a way that they need to control all electronic devices of a house remotely in a secured and safe manner. The smart home is one of the most mainstream applications which can improve the inhabitant’s life quality. Nevertheless, the security and protection problems of the house owner bring developing difficulties, while an ever-increasing number of information are gathered and shared by the various IoT gadgets inside the smart home. Blockchain for an IoT is a developing enchanting innovation strategy that gives a private, secure, and decentralized instrument for the information utilization in smart home. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; e-Reside; Home automation; IoT; Raspberry Pi","Ambient intelligence; Automation; Blockchain; Domestic appliances; Electric switches; Electron devices; Houses; Thermoelectric equipment; Advanced technology; Electronic device; Home automation systems; Information utilization; Innovation strategy; IoT; Security and protection; Technological world; IoT","","","","","","","Wu M., Wang K., Cai X., Guo S., Guo M., Rong C., A comprehensive survey of blockchain: From theory to IoT applications and beyond, IEEE IoT Journal, 6, 5, pp. 8114-8154, (2019); Boudguiga A., Et al., Towards better availability and accountability for iot updates by means of a blockchain, Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW) 2017 IEEE European Symposium, (2017); Yashiro T., Kobayashi S., Koshizuka N., Sakamura K., An IoT architecture for embedded appliances, International Conference, (2011); Malagund K., Mahalank S., Banakar R., Evolution of Lot in Smart Vehicles: An Overview, (2015); Suyama T., Kishino Y., Naya F., Abstracting IoT devices using virtual machine for wireless sensor nodes, IoT (Wf-Iot), (2014); Pereira P.P., Eliasson J., Kyusakov R., Delsing J., Raayatinezhad A., Johansson M., Enabling cloud-connectivity for Mobile IoT applications, IEEE Seventh International Symposium on Serviceoriented System Engineering, (2013); Tseng S.-P., Li B.-R., Pan J.-L., Lin C.-J., An application of IoT with motion sensing on smart house, IOCT, (2014); Jing L., Yamagishi K., Wang J., Zhou Y., Huang T., Cheng Z., A unified method for multiple home appliances control through static finger gestures, IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet, (2011); Coelho C., Coelho D., Wolf M., An IoT smart home architecture for long-term care of people with special needs, IEEE Conference; Yli-Huumo J., Ko D., Choi S., Park S., Smolander K., Where is current research on Blockchain technology?—A systematic review, Plos One, 11, 10, (2016); Leible S., Schlager S., Schubotz M., Gipp B., A review on Blockchain technology and Blockchain projects fostering open science.

With the plenty of manufacturers and the latest technologies, the usage of home automation is up to the mark. Firstly, from a social point of view, human care is very essential for physically challenged and elderly people. Secondly, it is implemented using a single Raspberry Pi controller. The controller controls and monitors many home appliances that are interconnected to form a home network. For example, the home appliances such as lights, Fans, temperature and humidity sensors, gas leakage detectors, smoke detectors, and fire detectors can be controlled by a single controller. It also includes the establishment of security and emergency alert systems in case of an emergency. So, this leads to an idea to develop a smart home controlling system for physically challenged people. The system developed must be low cost, low power consumption, cheaper, cost-effective, flexible and it should be user-friendly interface, same as the usage of the remote control of various electronic gadgets in our day-to-day life. It should be designed as user-friendly, so that the person can use it very easily and effectively same as, other hand-held devices. In this paper, a smartly controlling system was developed especially for physically challenged and elderly people. This was done by integrating Raspberry Pi and various sensors into the web applications. To design this system, a Raspberry Pi module along with a voice control technique is used. The output of this system is to control home appliances. All the home appliances are simply controlled by connecting through a monitor built on the internet. Raspberry Pi is used to operate and controls the motion sensors and voice recognition for controlling the home appliance through human voice to provide the smart home. It is a very simple technique that was very much helpful to helpless people.  © 2022 Author(s).","home appliances; Raspberry Pi; security; sensors; smart home; voice control","","","","","","DTMF, (7,8,10)","As mobile communications and GSM technology advance, researchers are becoming more interested in GSM-based home automation.

IoT applications are very helpful for the delivery of healthcare since they allow for safe and real-time remote patient monitoring enhancing people's lives. The goal of this study is to create an embedded system for tracking patients with chronic diseases that require regular checkups. This embedded system uses a Raspberry Pi 4b to gather data from several sensors installed in patients' bodies, and their data is constantly saved, analyzed and processed to extract vital details about their health and transfer it safely with the help of security encryption to the IoT cloud where it is organized into an interface making it easier to use and understand, which allows users like doctors to easily access patients' data and observing their health state from any place in the world. To enhance the functionality of the system, a warning system has been integrated into the IoT platform, which warns the doctor when the patient enters an abnormal state. A notification is also delivered to the doctor's mobile device if any parameter's value exceeds the cutoff. Because of this, IOT-based real-time health monitoring systems meticulously check patient health and, when necessary, save lives. © 2023 IEEE.","Chronic Disease; Embedded system; Health; IoT Platform; patients; Security Encryption; Sensors","Automation; Cryptography; Diseases; Embedded systems; Intelligent buildings; Interface states; mHealth; Real time systems; Remote patient monitoring; Chronic disease; Defense operations; Embedded-system; Health care operations; Internet of thing platform; Patient; Real- time; Security encryption; smart home; Transportation operations; IoT","","","","","","","Farahani B., Barzegari M., Shams Aliee F., Shaik K.A., Towards collaborative intelligent IoT eHealth: From device to fog, and cloud, Microprocessors and Microsystems, 72, (2020); Arfi W.B., Nasr I.B., Kondrateva G., Hikkerova L., The role of trust in intention to use the IoT in eHealth: Application of the modified UTAUT in a consumer context, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 167, (2021); Gutte A., Vadali R., IoT Based Health Monitoring System Using Raspberry Pi, 2018 Fourth International Conference on Computing Communication Control and Automation (ICCUBEA), pp. 1-5, (2018); Bhattacharya B., Mohapatra S., Mukhopadhyay A.P., Sah S., Remote cardiovascular health monitoring system with autodiagnosis, 2019 International Conference on Vision Towards Emerging Trends in Communication and Networking (ViTECoN), pp. 1-5, (2019); Kavya D.G.A.E.S.K.R., Health Monitoring System, PalArch's Journal of Archaeology of Egypt/Egyptology, 17, 9, (2020); Mubin M.F., Ahmed F., Islam R., IoT based Health Monitoring System for Elderly People; Hashim N., Norddin N., Idris F., Mohd Yusoff S.N.I., Zahari M., IoT blood pressure monitoring system, IJEECS, 19, 3, (2020); Tirkey A., Jesudoss A., A Non-Invasive Health Monitoring System for Diabetic Patients, International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing, (2020); Chekima A., Tung Yew H., Dargham J.A., Fung Ng M., Kheau Chung S., Zhi Ping S., IoT Based Real-Time Remote Patient Monitoring System, 16th IEEE International Colloquium on Signal Processing & its Applications (CSPA 2020), (2020); Rahman A., Uddin J., Haider Ghani N., Hossain S., Rahman T., IoT Based Patient Monitoring System Using ECG Sensor, International Conference on Robotics, Electrical and Signal Processing Techniques (ICREST), (2019); Raseduzzaman Ruman Md., Barua A., Rahman W., IoT based Emergency Health Monitoring System, 2020 International Conference on Industry 4. 0 Technology (14Tech); Mumrez A., Tariq H., Ajmal U., Abrar M., IoT Based Framework for E-Health Monitoring System, 2019 International Conference on Green and Human Information Technology (ICGHIT); Tamilselvi V., Sribalaji S., Vigneshwaran P., IoT based Health Monitoring System, 2020 6th International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Systems (ICACCS); Yeri V., Shubhangi D.C., IoT based Real Time Health Monitoring, Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA-2020); El-Rashidy N., El-Sappagh S., Islam S.R., M.

The revolution in technologies has made homes more convenient, efficient, and even more secure. The need for advancement in smart home technology is necessary due to the scarcity of intelligent home applications that cater to several aspects of the home simultaneously, i.e., automation, security, safety, and reducing energy consump-tion using less bandwidth, computation, and cost. Our research work provides a solution to these problems by deploying a smart home automation system with the applications mentioned above over a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi (RPI) device. The RPI is used as a central controlling unit, which provides a cost-effective platform for interconnecting a variety of devices and various sensors in a home via the Internet. We propose a cost-effective integrated system for smart home based on IoT and Edge-Computing paradigm. The proposed system provides remote and automatic control to home appliances, ensuring security and safety. Additionally, the proposed solution uses the edge-computing paradigm to store sensitive data in a local cloud to preserve the customer’s privacy. Moreover, visual and scalar sensor-generated data are processed and held over edge device (RPI) to reduce bandwidth, computation, and storage cost. In the comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed system is 5% faster in detecting motion, and 5 ms and 4 ms in switching relay on and off, respectively. It is also 6% more efficient than the existing solutions with respect to energy consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, where preventing virus transmission is of utmost importance, integrating home security with the IoT technology has become increasingly relevant. This study aims to develop a smart edge device for enhancing the security of houses in residential areas. A real-Time facial recognition security system is constructed using You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 7, in conjunction with the Facenet models. These models have been trained, evaluated, and integrated with a Raspberry Pi to establish communication with the user through Node-RED and the Telegram User Interface (UI), utilizing the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The performance of the developed facial recognition security system is compared with other state-of-The-Art systems in terms of facial recognition accuracy and inference speed on edge devices.

Recently, development has been done in this domain and few systems have been proposed that either use voice assistants or application for controlling the electrical appliances. However; less emphasis is laid on power efficiency and this system cannot be integrated with the existing appliances and hence, the entire system needs to be upgraded adding to a lot of additional cost in purchasing new appliances. In this research, the objective is to design such a system that emphasises on power efficiency as well as can be integrated with the already existing appliances. NodeMCU, along with Raspberry Pi, Firebase realtime database, is used to create a system that accomplishes such endeavours and can control relays, which can control these appliances without the need of replacing them. The experiments in this paper demonstrate triggering of electrical appliances using voice assistant, fire alarm on the basis of flame sensor and temperature sensor. Moreover; use of android was presented for operating electrical appliances from a remote location. Lastly, the system can be modified by adding security cameras, smart blinds, robot vacuums etc. © 2020 IEEE.","Adafruit IO; Arduino IDE; Google firebase application; IFTTT; Smart Home; Voice Assistant","Efficiency; Additional costs; android; Electrical appliances; Home automation; Power efficiency; Power efficient; Real-time database; Security cameras; Automation","","","","","","","Rajput H., Sawant K., Shetty D., Shukla P., Chougule A., Voice based home automation system using raspberry pi, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), E, (2018); Madhuri U., Khan R.A., Raspberry pi home automation with voice control, International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology (IJARIIT), 3, 6, (2017); Othman E.S., Voice controlled personal assistant using raspberry pi, International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research (IJSER), ISSN 2229-5518, 8, 11, (2017); Angeline R., Adithya S., Narayanan A., Fire alarm system using iot, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 8, 663; Singh S., Singh N., IoT: Security challenges, business opportunities & reference architecture for e-commerce, 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and IoT (ICGCIoT), Noida, pp. 1577-1581, (2015); Jara A.J., Wearable internet: Powering personal devices with the IoT capabilities, 2014 International Conference on Identification, Information and Knowledge in the IoT Beijing, (2014); Asadullah M., Raza A., An overview of home automation systems, 2016 2nd International Conference on Robotics and Artifical Intelligence (ICRAI), (2016); Pavithra D., Balakrishnan R., IoT based monitoring and control system for home automation, 2015 Global Conference on CommunicationTechnologies(GCCT), (2015); Jeyavinotha S., Deepika B.P., Remya R., Ajin N.V., Design of automation system to control the brightness of led using arduino uno and iot, International Journal of RecentTrends in Engineering& Research(IJRTER); Domingo M.C., An overview of the IoT for people with disabilities, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 35, 2, pp. 584-596, (2012); Chatterjee N., Chakraborty S., Decosta A., Asoke Nath D., Real-time communication application based on android using google firebase, International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management Studies","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2020","1 July 2020 through 3 July 2020","Kharagpur","164106","","978-172816851-7","","","English","Int.

These factors include declining public health, increase in chronic diseases, an ageing population, rising healthcare costs, the need to bring intelligence near the user for privacy, security, performance, and costs reasons, as well as COVID-19. Motivated by these drivers, this paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a reference architecture called Imtidad that provides Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a Service (DAIaaS) over cloud, fog, and edge using a service catalog case study containing 22 AI skin disease diagnosis services. These services belong to four service classes that are distinguished based on software platforms (containerized gRPC, gRPC, Android, and Android Nearby) and are executed on a range of hardware platforms (Google Cloud, HP Pavilion Laptop, NVIDIA Jetson nano, Raspberry Pi Model B, Samsung Galaxy S9, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4) and four network types (Fiber, Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth). The AI models for the diagnosis include two standard Deep Neural Networks and two Tiny AI deep models to enable their execution at the edge, trained and tested using 10,015 real-life dermatoscopic images. The services are evaluated using several benchmarks including model service value, response time, energy consumption, and network transfer time. A DL service on a local smartphone provides the best service in terms of both energy and speed, followed by a Raspberry Pi edge device and a laptop in fog. The services are designed to enable different use cases, such as patient diagnosis at home or sending diagnosis requests to travelling medical professionals through a fog device or cloud. This is the pioneering work that provides a reference architecture and such a detailed implementation and treatment of DAIaaS services, and is also expected to have an extensive impact on developing smart distributed service infrastructures for healthcare and other sectors. © 2022 by the authors.

This can benefit home security. A case study was devised to remotely sense, inform and actuate. The study developed a surveillance system using Raspberry Pi and camera to detect and recognize a door caller’s face from a live video stream and compare with an existing dataset to verify whether the person was authorized. If not authorized, the remote homeowner can be alerted via an email complete with an image of the caller. Automated and user actions can be performed depending on the type of visitor. RaspController, Google Assistant and VNC were used for actuation, to perform actions like playing random music, triggering voice conversations or turning on an alarm. The recognition system was developed in Python using OpenCV and face recognition, using pre trained models for Hog detection and Haar Cascade classification. The accuracy of the detection was 66.7% for a small cohort of seven authorized people and an unauthorized class of five people. For actuation, interoperability with many smart home devices can be controlled from the smart home network, but with only limited functionality from a remote network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Face recognition; Google Assistant; Home Security; IoT; OpenCV; Raspberry Pi","Automation; Classification (of information); Face recognition; Home networks; Intelligent buildings; Network security; Personal communication systems; Remote sensing; Security systems; Case-studies; Google assistant; Google+; Home security; Live video; Opencv; Raspberry pi; Remote-sensing; smart home; Surveillance systems; IoT","","","","","","","Rayes A., Salam S., IoT: From Hype to Reality: The Road to Digitization, (2019); Akter S., Sima R.A., Ullah M.S., Hossain S.A., Smart security surveillance using IoT, Proceedings of The, (2018); Lalitha R., Kavitha K., Rao N., Mounika G., Sandhya V., Smart surveillance with smart doorbell, Int.

Adjusting to a Work-From-Home (WFH) culture has become mandatory by maintaining required core security principles. Therefore, implementing and maintaining a secure Smart Home System has become even more challenging. ARGUS provides an overall network security coverage for both incoming and outgoing traffic, a firewall and an adaptive bandwidth management system and a sophisticated CCTV surveillance capability. ARGUS is such a system that is implemented into an existing router incorporating cloud and Machine Learning (ML) technology to ensure seamless connectivity across multiple devices, including IoT devices at a low migration cost for the customer. The aggregation of the above features makes ARGUS an ideal solution for existing Smart Home System service providers and users where hardware and infrastructure is also allocated. ARGUS was tested on a small-scale smart home environment with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B controller. Its intrusion detection system identified an intrusion with 96% accuracy while the physical surveillance system predicts the user with 81% accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.","Activity Monitoring; Bandwidth Management; Cyber Security; Firewall; Intrusion Detection; IoT; Smart Home System; Surveillance","Automation; Bandwidth; Computer system firewalls; Cybersecurity; IoT; Network security; Activity monitoring; Bandwidth management; Cyber security; Firewall; Intrusion-Detection; IoT; Security solutions; smart home; Smart-home system; Surveillance; Intrusion detection","","","","","","","Vaidya V.D., Vishwakarma P., A Comparative Analysis on Smart Home System to Control, Monitor and Secure Home, based on technologies like GSM, IOT, Bluetooth and PIC Microcontroller with ZigBee Modulation, 2018 Int.

Resource constrained devices face serious issues to run complex cryptographic algorithms. Trying to evaluate the performance impact of those algorithms in usual and common devices used in smart home, in this paper we tested the impact of different cryptographic algorithms in low computational devices, typically used in smart devices applied in smart home, testing different security configurations and using the two most used transport protocols (HTTP and MQTT). The experiment measures their effects on six commonly used embedded devices in IoT WSNs: ESP8622, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi (RPi) from 1 to 4. The experiment measured the power consumption, message delay, and additional message length (bytes). Moreover, the analysis was also used to model security algorithms. The experimental results from long runs (72 hours) reveal the cryptographic solution choice is significant for the message delay and additional message length. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cryptography; IoT; Privacy; Security; Smart home; WSN","Automation; Data privacy; HTTP; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Communication paradigm; Cryptographic algorithms; IoT; Message delay; Message length; Privacy; Security; Smart devices; smart home; WSN; Cryptography","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES, (UIDB/50008/2020-UIDP/50008/2020)","This work is funded by FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU funds under the project UIDB/50008/2020-UIDP/50008/2020.

The visually impaired users rely heavily on these IoT devices and assistive technologies for guidance, medical usage, mobility help, voice recognition, news feeds and emergency communications. However, cyber attackers are deploying Evil Twin and Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, among others, to penetrate the network, establish rogue Wi-Fi access points and trick victims into connecting to it, leading to interceptions, manipulation, exploitation, compromising the smart devices and taking command and control. The paper aims to explore the Evil Twin attack on smart devices and provide mitigating techniques to improve privacy and trust. The novelty contribution of the paper is three-fold: First, we identify the various IoT device vulnerabilities and attacks. We consider the state-of-the-art IoT cyberattacks on Smart TVs, Smart Door Lock, and cameras. Secondly, we created a virtual environment using Kali Linux (Raspberry Pi) and NetGear r7000 as the home router for our testbed. We deployed an Evil Twin attack to penetrate the network to identify the vulnerable spots on the IoT devices. We consider the Kill Chain attack approach for the attack pattern. Finally, we recommend a security mechanism in a table to improve security, privacy and trust. Our results show how vulnerabilities in smart home appliances are susceptible to attacks. We have recommended mitigation techniques to enhance the security for visually impaired users.  © 2023 IEEE.","Cyber Security; IoT; Privacy; smart home; Visually Impaired","Assistive technology; Automation; Computer operating systems; Domestic appliances; IoT; Network security; Wi-Fi; Assistive technology; Cyber security; Device technologies; News feeds; Privacy; Privacy and trusts; Smart devices; smart home; Visually impaired; Visually-impaired users; Cybersecurity","","","","","","","Murugesan K., Thangadorai K.K., Muralidhara V.N., PoEx: Proof of Existence for Evil Twin Attack Prevention in Wi-Fi Personal Networks, 2021 8th International Conference on Future IoT and Cloud (FiCloud), pp. 92-98, (2021); Ayavaca-Vallejo L., Avila-Pesantez D., Smart Home IoT Cybersecurity Survey: A Systematic Mapping, 2023 Conference on Information Communications Technology and Society (ICTAS), pp. 1-6, (2023); Bauer K., Gonzales H., McCoy D., Mitigating Evil Twin Attacks in 802.11, 2008 Ieee International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference, pp. 513-516, (2008); Bhatia P., Laurendeau C., Barbeau M., Solution to the wireless evil-twin transmitter attack, 2010 Fifth International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS), pp. 1-7, (2010); State of IoT 2023: Number of connected IoT devices growing 16%to 16 billion globally, IoT Analytics, (2023); Nazar N., Darvishi I., Yeboah-Ofori A., Cyber Threat Analysis on Online Learning and Its Mitigation Techniques Amid Covid-19, 2022 Ieee International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2), pp. 1-7, (2022); Olazabal A.A., Kaur J., Yeboah-Ofori A., Deploying Man-Inthe-Middle Attack on IoT Devices Connected to Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN), 2022 Ieee International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2), pp. 1-7, (2022); Rahman M.A., Abualsaud K., Barnes S., Rashid M., Abdullah S.M., A Natural User Interface and Blockchain-Based In-Home Smart Health Monitoring System, 2020 Ieee International Conference on Informatics, IoT, and Enabling Technologies (ICIoT), pp. 262-266, (2020); Elmannai W., Elleithy K., Sensor-Based Assistive Devices for Visually-Impaired People: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Directions, Sensors, 17, 3, (2017); Mosadeghrad A.M., Factors Affecting Medical Service Quality, 43, (2014); Deogirikar J., Vidhate A., Security attacks in IoT: A survey, 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 32-37, (2017); Bandekar A., Javaid A.Y., Cyber-attack Mitigation and Impact Analysis for Low-power IoT Devices, 2017 Ieee 7th Annual International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER), pp. 1631-1636, (2017); Swarna Sugi S.S., Ratna S.R., Investigation of Machine Learning Techniques in Intrusion Detection System for IoT Network, 2020 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS), pp. 1164-1167, (2020); Nagarkar S., Evaluating Privacy and Security Threats in IoT-based Smart Home Environment, 14, 7, (2019); Seth A.D., Biswas S., Dhar A.K., De-Authentication Attack Detection using Discrete Event Systems in 802.11 Wi-Fi Networks, 2019 Ieee International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS), pp. 1-6, (2019); Abdullah T.A.A., Ali W., Malebary S., Ahmed A.A., A Review of Cyber Security Challenges, Attacks and Solutions for IoT Based Smart Home, (2019); Zhou W., Et al., Discovering and Understanding the Security Hazards in the Interactions between IoT Devices, Mobile Apps, and Clouds on Smart Home Platforms, (2019)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Smart Cities Initiative","9th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference, ISC2 2023","24 September 2023 through 27 September 2023","Bucharest","194043","","979-835039775-8","","","English","Proc.

Home security has always been a field of concern among mass people. Making home security systems safer, cheaper and easy to understand is a challenge that many engineers around the world are striving to achieve in developing countries. Considering the economic condition of people of a developing country like Bangladesh, we propose an IoT based smart home security and automation system named 'Facebook messenger Chatbot' which is made using Raspberry PI as the central processor. It will enable its users to use it free of cost as Facebook messenger app is free in Bangladesh. People can use it from home or any remote location and can control digital home appliances like fans, lights etc. Smart door locking system, face recognition, gas leakage detection, temperature detection and control, humidity detection, fire detection, which has been done through collecting data from different sensors and passing them to Raspberry PI and then PI passes these to the BOT through a REST API, are the additional features that make our security system safer, effective and easier to use compared to other existing approaches.  © 2020 IEEE.","Chatbot; Facebook Messenger; Home automation system; IoT (IoT); Raspberry Pi (RPi); REST APL; Security System","Ambient intelligence; Automation; Developing countries; Digital devices; Domestic appliances; Enterprise resource planning; Humidity control; IoT; Security systems; Social networking (online); Automation systems; Central processors; Economic condition; Fire detection; Home security systems; Humidity detection; Remote location; Temperature detection; Face recognition","","","","","","","Statista I.H.S, IoT connected devices installed base worldwide from 2015 to 2025 (in billions, (2018); Gautam A., Bareja D., Virdi S.K., Shekar S., Verma G., Implementation of high performance home automation using arduino, Indian J Sci Technol, 9, (2016); Mubarak M., IoT for Home Automation, (2016); Hamdan O., Shanableh H., Zaki I., Al-Ali A.R., Shanableh T., Iot-based interactive dual mode smart home automation, In 2019 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE, pp. 1-2, (2019); Kodali R.K., Jain V., Bose S., Boppana L., Iot based smart security and home automation system, In 2016 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA, pp. 1286-1289, (2016); Mandula K., Parupalli R., Murty C.A., Magesh E., Lunagariya R., Mobile based home automation using IoT (iot, In 2015 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCICCT, pp. 340-343, (2015); Mahmud S., Ahmed S., Shikder K., A smart home automation and metering system using IoT (iot, In 2019 International Conference on Robotics, Electrical and Signal Processing Techniques (ICREST, pp. 451-454, (2019); Lakshmi R., Karthika P., Rajalakshmi A., Sathya M., Smart-home automation using iot-based sensing and monitoring platform, International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 5, 1, (2019); Quadri S.A.I., Sathish P., Iot based home automation and surveillance system, In 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS, pp. 861-866, (2017); Singh A.K., Agrawal S., Agarwal S., Goyal D., Low-cost and energy-efficient smart home security and automation, In Computational Network Application Tools for Performance Management, pp. 95-108, (2020); Gaikwad P.P., Gabhane J.P., Golait S.S., A survey based on smart home system using internet-of-things, In 2015 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC, pp. 0330-0335, (2015); Hazra S., Sengupta N., Pal A., Acharyya S., Satpati B., An innovative position detection pathway to facilitate low-cost home automation, In 2019 Second International Conference on Advanced Computational and Communication Paradigms (ICACCP, pp. 1-8, (2019); Kumar S., Ubiquitous Smart Home System Using android, (2014); Dayana B.D., Reddy C.R., Meher P., Shrivastava S., Kumar G., Smart Home Automation Using IoT with Security Features, (2018); Gupta A., Srivastava A., Anand R., Cost-effective smart home automation using IoT, Journal of Communication Engineering & Systems, 9, 2, pp. 1-6, (2019); Gill S.S., Garraghan P., Buyya R., Router: Fog enabled cloud based intelligent resource management approach for smart home iot devices, Journal of Systems and Software, (2019); Swathi Y., Shanthi M.B., Kumari S., Batni P., Security enabled smart home using IoT, In International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies, pp. 808-814, (2019); Lohan V., Singh R.P., Home automation using IoT, In Advances in Data and Information Sciences, pp. 293-301, (2019)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2020 IEEE Region 10 Symposium, TENSYMP 2020","5 June 2020 through 7 June 2020","Virtual, Dhaka","164636","","978-172817366-5","","","English","IEEE Reg. 10 Symp., TENSYMP","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096419325"

Some of the key areas to be looked into are authentication of devices connected through internet, secure identification, data privacy, continuous internet connectivity and the security of data stored. The existing systems lack either of these issues, but our proposed system not only satisfies them but has intelligent and smart decision-making capability. Our paper primarily concentrates on children safety and ensures security in every aspect. The proposed system employs Raspberry Pi for processing the data which is measured by the sensor and communicate to the user through the internet. As Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest version and has much more functions, it is used and provided with Type C supply. The designed system helps to save the small children from the harmful or tragic situation in the absence of parents. The solenoid lock works according to the command given by the user through the mobile application. Hence as the user commands according to the information that he observe on his mobile application.

However, an IoT system such as a smart grid with poorly designed topology and weak security protocols might be vulnerable to cybercrimes. Exploits may arise from sensor data interception en route to the intended consumer within an IoT system. The increasing integration of electronic devices interconnected via the internet has galvanized the acceptance of this technology. Nonetheless, as the number of users of this technology surges, there must be an aligned concern to ensure that security measures are diligently enforced within IoT communication systems, such as in smart home, smart cities, smart factories, smart hospitals, and smart grids. This research addresses security lacunae in the topology and configuration of IoT energy monitoring systems using post-quantum cryptographic techniques. We propose tailored implementations of the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), N-th degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRU), and a suite of cryptographic primitives based on Module Learning With Rounding (Saber) as post-quantum cryptographic candidate algorithms for IoT devices. These aim to secure publisher–subscriber end-to-end communication in energy system monitoring. Additionally, we offer a comparative analysis of these tailored implementations on low-resource devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, during data transmission using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Results indicate that the customized implementation of NTRU outperforms both SABER and RSA in terms of CPU and memory usage, while Light SABER emerges as the front-runner when considering encryption and decryption delays. © 2023 by the authors.","IoT; NTRU; post-quantum encryption; RSA; SABER; system monitoring","","","","","","School of Engineering, Applied Science","This research was funded by the School of Engineering, Applied Science, and Technology at Canadian University Dubai, Dubai, UAE.","Mohamad Noor M., Hassan W.H., Current research on IoT security: A survey, Comput.

Recently, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) have become easy targets for attackers since they don’t have cyber defense mechanism in place other than simple firewall systems which are quite vulnerable. Cyber defense systems are costly and often not within the budget of SMEs which inspired to think about low cost yet highly efficient cyber defense solutions. This research explores the prospects of implementing a Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi)-based intelligent cyber-defense system (iCDS) for SME networks and Smart-homes to filter malicious contents from incoming traffic. Primarily, the work presented in this paper tries to evaluate the hardware capability of network interfaces (both internal, and attached) of Raspberry Pi for handle high volumes of incoming traffic. For this, we measure the network performance of the Raspberry Pi using the speed test software. The results show that the built in Ethernet interface outperforms the built in WiFi and external attached USB to Ethernet Adapter in terms of latency, download and upload throughput. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Cyber defense; Intelligent cyber-defense system; Raspberry-Pi","Budget control; Costs; Cybersecurity; Ethernet; Intelligent buildings; Malware; Network security; Software testing; Cyber-defense; Defence mechanisms; Defence systems; Exploratory studies; Incoming traffic; Intelligent cybe-defense system; Raspberry-pi; Simple++; Small to medium enterprise; Automation","","","","","","","Khraisat A., Gondal I., Vamplew P., Kamruzzaman J., Survey of intrusion detection systems: Techniques, datasets and challenges, Cybersecurity, 2, 1, pp. 1-22, (2019); Ali B., Awad A.I., Cyber and Physical Security Vulnerability Assessment for iot-Based smart home, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, (2018); Granjal J., Monteiro E., Silva J.S., Security for the IoT: A survey of existing protocols and open research issues, IEEE Commun.

We propose as an exploratory study based on design science research with two iterations: laboratory experiment, presented here and has future work the real context experiment, vital signs monitor system for smart health tourism that allows to the tourist to visit to local interest points without neglect the health treatments and medical monitoring. Thus, the system operates inside and outside health facilities in order to be possible to get the vital signs of the health tourist. Since the data will be acquired outside health facilities an information security risk assessment was made and the security measures were promoted. The system is composed by many technologies, such as: smartwatch, raspberry pi, wireless sensor networks, among others and software. The vital signs acquired are temperature, blood pressure, heart beat, blood oxygen level and, finally, the accelerometer will be used to detect falls. Beside this an adaptive artificial intelligence system will be used to predict health problems of the health tourist. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Health and wellness tourism; Smart cities; Smart tourism","Blood; Blood pressure; Health; Health risks; IoT; Monitoring; Risk assessment; Security of data; Wireless sensor networks; Energy-transport; Health and wellness; Health and wellness tourism; Health facilities; Health tourisms; Home automation; Monitor system; Smart tourism; System models; Vital sign; Smart city","","","","","","","Fernandes J., Thalassa, thermae, SPA—salute per agua, Plátano, (2006); Pechlaner H., Fischer E., Alpine Wellness: A Resource-Based View, 31, pp. 67-77, (2015); Savchuk V., Lozynska O., Kunanets N., Pasichnyk V., Medical tourism information support system, IEEE 2Nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON).

Public places like institutions, organisations, banks, parks, etc or even homes need to be guarded to prevent theft or an attack. It is impossible for a single guard to man all the probable locations of intrusions at the same time for 24 hours and adding multiple guards will increase operational costs thereby adding financial burden on institutions. CCTVs are a static mode of surveillance as they are immovable and it needs multiple devices to be set up to completely cover an area. We aim to provide a solution by developing an IoT based Smart Surveillance System. This system consists of a robot with wheels attached which makes it mobile in nature and has an ultrasonic sensor mounted for object detection and the components are controlled by Arduino UNO. Also the robot has a camera mounted on top for Face Detection and the camera is controlled by Raspberry Pi. The system displays a live video feed and also notifies the user if a face is detected on the video feed, by raising an alarm and also on registered email along with the last captured frame. Thus, our system will help in safeguarding important places with minimal effort and will provide timely updates.  © 2023 IEEE.","alert; face detection; obstacle detection; security; surveillance","Cameras; IoT; Object detection; Obstacle detectors; Security systems; Ultrasonic applications; Alert; Faces detection; Multiple devices; Objects detection; Obstacles detection; Public places; Security; Smart surveillance systems; Static modes; Surveillance; Face recognition","","","","","","","Akilan T., Chaudhary S., Kumari P., Pandey U., Surveillance Robot in Hazardous Place Using IoT Technology, 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN), (2020); Kumari V.R., Sanjay P.S., Smart Surveillance Robot using Object Detection, International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing, (2020); Rajkumar K., Kumar C., Yuvashree C., Murugan S., Portable Surveillance Robot using IOT, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), 3, 6, (2019); Ashok G., Shravan A., Saikrishna B., Kumar T., Raspberry pi based Surveillance Robot for Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Tracking, International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IRCRT), 8, 5, (2020); Rao B., Sudheer R., Surveillance Camera using IoT and Raspberry Pi, Second International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA-2020), (2020); Patil R., Srinivas R., Rohith Y., Vinay N., Pratiba D., IoT enabled Video Surveillance System using Raspberry Pi, 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS), (2017); Richardson T., Stafford-Fraser Q., Wood K.R., Hopper A., Virtual network computing, IEEE Internet Computing, 2, 1, (1998); Shaikh S., Kumar P., Kshirsagar R., Chouhan M., Bhagwat A., Raspberry pi based Surveillance Robot for Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Tracking, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), 8, 5, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 International Conference on IoT, Communication and Automation Technology, ICICAT 2023","23 June 2023 through 24 June 2023","Gorakhpur","193130","","979-835030282-0","","","English","Int.

This is for intrusion detection along with a proprietary android. Intruder-Spi makes use of relatively low cost but effective wireless sensors network that makes it an affordable security system to buy when compared to other expensive CCTV camera systems. This implements a home security automated intrusion detection system which alerts the host using ‘Twilio’ API. The detection system comprises of a laser tripwire. The android has been developed using the Python programming language on the server side and Java is being used to develop the application on the client side. The system notifies the user about any possible theft or intrusion in one’s environment by clicking pictures and recording a video for a period using a proprietary Raspberry Pi camera and storing it into the MySQL database in the Raspberry Pi itself. Apache2 is the web-server being used on the Pi to serve client requests being made from the Android device which will eventually show the respective captured images and videos to the registered users who can then control the application remotely. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Android; Application; Intrusion; IoT; Laser; LDR; Network; Raspberry Pi3; Security; Sensors; Wireless","Cameras; Costs; IoT; Intrusion detection; Network security; Security systems; Wireless sensor networks; Android; android; Home security systems; Intrusion; Intrusion-Detection; LDR; Low-costs; Network; Raspberry pi3; Security; android","","","","","","","Burglary crime statistics and facts; Sabri N., Aljunid S.A., Ahmad B., Yahya A., Kamaruddin R., Salim M.S., Wireless sensor actor network based on fuzzy inference system for greenhouse climate control, Journal of Applied Sciences, 11, 17, pp. 3104-3116, (2011); Muheden K., Erdem E., Vancin S., Design and implementation of the mobile fire alarm system using wireless sensor networks, In 2016 IEEE 17Th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI), pp. 000243-000246, (2016); Shah D., Haradi V., IoT based biometrics implementation on raspberry Pi, Procedia Computer Science, 79, pp. 328-336, (2016); Cook D.J., Das S.K., Technologies, Protocols and Applications, ARO Research Grant DAAD, (2004); Goyal S., Desai P., Swaminathan V., Multi-level security embedded with surveillance system, IEEE Sensors Journal, 17, 22, pp. 7497-7501, (2017); Chirag B., Manjunath A.E., Design and implementation of cost effective surveillance robot, 2014 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Aided System Engineering (APCASE), pp. 141-145, (2014); Nguyen H.Q., Loan T.T.K., Mao B.D., Huh E.N., Low cost real-time system monitoring using Raspberry Pi, 2015 Seventh International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks, pp. 857-859, (2015); Statistics Canada: Burglar Stats; Book; Home Security Systems 101: Things to Consider; Top Factors while Choosing a Home Secuirty System from Website; Shahzad F., Low-cost intruder detection and alert system using mobile phone proximity sensor, 2017 International Conference on Innovations in Electrical Engineering and Computational Technologies (ICIEECT), pp. 1-5, (2017); Kim T., Lee H., Chung Y., Advanced universal remote controller for home automation and security, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 56, 4, pp. 2537-2542, (2010); Jose A.C., Malekian R., Improving smart home security: Integrating logical sensing into smart home, IEEE Sensors Journal, 17, 13, pp. 4269-4286, (2017); Raspberry Pi Website; Venkatesan S., Jawahar A., Varsha S., Roshne N., Design and implementation of an automated security system using Twilio messaging service, 2017 International Conference on Smart Cities, Automation & Intelligent Computing Systems (ICON-SONICS), pp. 59-63, (2017)","H.

Implementing an The IoT-based smart home has attracted a great deal of attention has developed into an important area of study in the modern day. 'Home automation' refers to the automatic and computerised control of appliances, activities, and aspects of the home. Simply said, it means you may easily manage the utilities and operations of your home over the Internet, simplifying and securing daily tasks while also reducing household expenses. The smart home idea improves the comfort and convenience of our lives with the help of IoT. The two key issues in the current smart home environment are automation and security. Sensors that can keep an eye on variations in the amount of daylight, the temperature, or motion detection can be used. These (and other) parameters may then be customised by home automation systems to suit your preferences. In this paper, the above problem is investigated using hardware that is simple, inexpensive, and easily available. Despite the hardware's modest cost, its capabilities should not be overlooked. This system can be incredibly powerful and secure if the correct tools are used. In this paper, the viability of such a setup is assessed for everyday usage and was found to be quite effective.  © 2022 IEEE.","ESP; Home Automation; IoT; Raspberry Pi","Automation; Computer hardware; 'current; Computerized controls; Daily tasks; ESP; Home automation; Home security; IoT architectures; Key Issues; Raspberry pi; smart home; IoT","","","","","","","Mihalache A., Wireless Home Automation System using IoT, Informatica Economica., 21, pp. 17-32, (2017); Mahmud S., Ahmed S., Shikder K., A Smart Home Automation and Metering System using IoT, 2019 International Conference on Robotics, Electrical and Signal Processing Techniques (ICREST), pp. 451-454, (2019); Haque M.E., Islam M.R., Fazle Rabbi M.T., Rafiq J.I., IoT Based Home Automation System with Customizable GUI and Low Cost Embedded System, 2019 International Conference on Sustainable Technologies for Industry 4. 0 (STI), pp. 1-5, (2019); Paul K.V., John Selvaraj N.S., Gokul Kumar G., Smart Home Automation with Home Security using IoT, National Conference on Emerging Trends in Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering (ETEEC-2018), (2018); Sehgal T., More S., Home Automation using IOT and Mobile App, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), (2017); Gulghane K.S., Sherekar S.S., Thakare D.V., IoT Based Smart Home Automation System, International Journal for Research in Engineering Application & Management, (2020); Jabbar W.A., Alsibai M.H., Amran N.S.S., Mahayadin S.K., Design and Implementation of IoT-Based Automation System for Smart Home, 2018 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC), pp. 1-6, (2018); Agarwal K., Agarwal A., Misra G., Review and Performance Analysis on Wireless Smart Home and Home Automation using IoT, 2019 Third International conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 629-633, (2019); Saranyadevi G., Thresa P., Duraivel A.N., Bhuvaneshwaran K., Cost Efficient IoT Based Home Automation with Security system, International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 119, 16, pp. 1697-1701, (2018); Alsuhaym F., Al-Hadhrami T., Saeed F., Awuson-David K., Toward Home Automation: An IoT Based Home Automation System Control and Security, pp. 1-11, (2021); Chaurasia T., Jain P.K., Enhanced Smart Home Automation System based on IoT, 2019 Third International conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 709-713, (2019); Eleyan A., Fallon J., IoT-based Home Automation Using android, 2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC), pp. 1-4, (2020); Kundu D., Khallil M., Das T., Mamun A., Musha A., Smart Home Automation System Using on IoT, International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 11, pp. 697-701, (2020); Brundha S.M., Lakshmi P., Santhanalakshmi S., Home automation in client-server approach with user notification along with efficient security alerting system, 2017 International Conference On Smart Technologies For Smart Nation (SmartTechCon), pp. 596-601, (2017); Chakraborty T., Datta S.K., Home automation using edge computing and IoT, 2017 IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE), pp. 47-49, (2017); Dhanabalan S.S., Sitharthan R., Madurakavi K., Thirumurugan A., Rajesh M., Avaninathan S.R., Carrasco M.F., Flexible compact system for wearable health monitoring applications, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 102, (2022); Nithiyanandam N., Rajesh M., Sitharthan R., Shanmuga Sundar D., Vengatesan K., Madurakavi K., Optimization of Performance and Scalability Measures across Cloud Based IoT Applications with Efficient Scheduling Approach, International Journal of Wireless Information Networks, pp. 1-12, (2022); Hassan M.A., Javed A.R., Hassan T., Band S.S., Sitharthan R., Rizwan M., Reinforcing Communication on the Internet of Aerial Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, (2022)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Power, Energy, Control and Transmission Systems, ICPECTS 2022","8 December 2022 through 9 December 2022","Virtual, Online","186977","","978-166546275-4","","","English","Int.

Even with the right involvement of manpower, it is difficult to identify unusual events like fire accidents, gas leakage, and motion or presence of an intruder. The IoT is a technology in which all devices communicate with each other through the internet. This technology can be used in our home security systems in an effective manner. Many existing systems failed to meet some challenging issues like multi-sensing operations, delay in alerts and non-continuous monitoring due to power breakdowns. In this paper, we developed an IoT-based smart security alert system which is used to send alerts to the owner through SMS and email whenever there is an intruder or other harmful activities are taking place at the home. This system mainly consists of Raspberry Pi-3, Pi camera, power shifting circuit, gas sensor, fire sensor, IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, GSM module, Buzzer and mobile. In the proposed system, whenever any intruder is detected the system will capture an image and alert the user by sending SMS and email to the user. It also provides security regarding fire and smoke by sending SMS to the user. Our proposed system is also equipped with a power shifter circuit which provides continuous supply to the circuit for continuous monitoring. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-Automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others. The main purpose of our paper is to build a perfect smart home-helper for the users to operate the home appliances easily through voice commands. © 2020 IEEE.","Raspberry Pi; Smart Home System; Voice Recognition","Alarm systems; Ambient intelligence; Automation; Domestic appliances; Environmental management; IoT; Man machine systems; Natural language processing systems; Centralized control systems; Electrical home appliances; Hardware and software components; Home automation systems; IoT; NAtural language processing; Operating switches; Speech recognition modules; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Sikandar M., Khiyal H., Khan A., Shehzadi E., Sms Based Wireless Home Appliance Control System ( Hacs ) for Automating Appliances and Security Preliminaries Home Appliance Control System ( Hacs ), 6, (2009); Pawar P.N., Ramachandran S., Singh N.P., Wagh V.V., Student B.E., A Home Automation System using the IoT, Int.

One major category in which technology benefits us is the concept of security and privacy. Smartphones can act as a security alert system as the smartphone is the most widely-used smart device. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-integrated smart IoT devices has significantly increased as well. In this paper, we developed a smart IoT security system for the smart-home. In which, a Raspberry Pi acts as a security system with a No Infrared (NoIR) Pi Camera Module to record videos and capture images. Also, a Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensor is used to detect motion. We propose to use motion sensor data and the images gathered from the NoIR Pi Camera Module to predict a security threat using a face recognition classification technique along with our developed algorithm. The system has the capability to notify the user in case of any emergency. The proposed system can detect any security threat with an accuracy of 95.5% and a precision of 91%. © 2020 IEEE.","Face Recognition; Motion; Security System; Smart IoT; Smart-Home","Ambient intelligence; Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Cameras; Face recognition; Mobile security; Motion analysis; Motion sensors; Privacy by design; Security systems; Smartphones; Classification technique; Facial recognition; IoT; Motion detection; Passive infrared; Security alerts; Security and privacy; Security threats; IoT","","","","","USC Upstate","We would like to thank the Office of the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science at USC Upstate for the partial funding of this project.

Starting with telephone-controlled home appliances and a simple camera-based system, home automation and video surveillance have now entered the IoT (IoT) and IoE (Internet of Everything) era, where every device integrated smart are connected to worldwide network and controlled abroad. Home automation makes life easier by providing control of all home appliances at one point, which is basically by a smartphone. The need for surveillance is rapidly increasing in domestic and commercial applications due to its low cost and ease of deployment. To ensure the security of video surveillance of personal homes and small businesses, people resort to third-party organizations with expensive equipment. In turn, the solution for providing a video surveillance security system based on a Rasp berry Pi single-board computer using HomeAssistant software is more profitable and easier to implement. The choice fell on the HomeAssistant software, since HomeAssistant is an open source application and does not require additional costs. This article analyzes how home automation and video surveillance systems have been modified and implemented. For the review, the Home Assistant smart home platform was implemented with the introduction of a video surveillance system.  © 2022 IEEE.","control panel; control system; Home Assistant; Intelligent Control Systems; IoT; Raspberry Pi; smart home","Application programs; Automation; Control systems; Costs; Domestic appliances; Internet of Everything; Monitoring; Open source software; Open systems; Security systems; Control panels; Home assistant; Home automation; Home videos; Intelligent control system; Raspberry pi; Simple++; smart home; Video surveillance; Video surveillance systems; IoT","","","","","IsDB, (2021-588606); Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan, (BR10965311)","The authors wish to thank everyone who made every effort to improve the content of this research paper.

Most considered it to be ""secure"" because of the line-of-sight usage within the home. In this paper, we revisit the security of IR remote control schemes and examine their security assumptions under the settings of internet-connected smart home. We focus on two specific questions: (1) whether IR signals could be sniffed by an IoT device; and (2) what information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals. To answer these questions, we design a sniff module using a commercial-off-the-shelf IR receiver on a Raspberry Pi and show that the Infrared (IR) signal emanating from the remote control of a Smart TV can be captured by one of the nearby IoT devices, for example, a smart air-conditioner, even the signal is not aimed at the air-conditioner. The IR signal range and receiving angle are larger than most have thought. We also developed algorithms to extract semantic information from the sniffed IR control signals, and evaluated with realworld applications. The results showed that lots of sensitive information could be leaked out through the sniffed IR control signals, including account name and password, PIN code, and even payment information. © USENIX Security 2023.

In addition, they have the potential to connect people to many services on the market to gain access. Security is one of the issues with the user accessing the data through the connected network. In essence, the public network is more vulnerable and the information transferred to systems is not properly encrypted. Furthermore, the network is accessible to anyone those who have the understanding of the computer network. The intruders may use the public network to plough the freedom users from surfing internet by blocking with their websites or advertisements. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network that uses their encryption mechanism to link two different networks together using public telecommunications and to providing services through World Wide Web. In this paper, a prototype model is designed for VPN gateway connection using Raspberry Pi which in turn to connect the house network with the ISP network. Through this a VPN network services like security and scalability is guaranteed to the home systems using the proposed prototype. © 2022 IEEE.","Cloud VPN Server; IoT based VPN; Open VPN; Raspberry Pi","Cryptography; Gateways (computer networks); Location based services; Network security; Personal communication systems; Telecommunication services; Virtual private networks; Blockings; Cloud virtual private network server; Connected networks; IoT based virtual private network; Network server; Open virtual private network; Public networks; Raspberry pi; Smart cell phones; Tablet computer; IoT","","","","","","","Mao H., Zhu L., Qin H., A Comparative Research on SSL VPN and IPSec VPN, 2012 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, pp. 1-4, (2012); Raghavan N., Gopal R., Annaluru S., Kura S., Virtual private networks and their role in e-business, Bell Labs Technical Journal, 6, 2, pp. 99-115, (2002); Bateni M., Gerber A., Hajiaghayi M., Sen S., Multi-VPN Optimization for Scalable Routing via Relaying, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 18, 5, pp. 1544-1556, (2010); Juma M., Abdel Monem A., Shaalan K., Hybrid End-to-End VPN Security Approach for Smart IoT Objects, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 158, pp. 1-14, (2020); Longworth J., VPN: from an obscure network to a widespread solution, Computer Fraud & Security, 2018, 4, pp. 14-15, (2018); Gheisariy M., Wang G., Khanz W.Z., Fernandez-Campusano C., A Context-aware Privacy-preserving Method for IoT-based Smart City Using Software Defined Networking, Computers & Security, (2019); Arfaoui A., Kribeche A., Senouci S.M., Hamdi M., Game-Based Adaptive Remote Access VPN for IoT: Application to e-Health, 2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), pp. 1-7, (2018); Shif L., Wang F., Lung C., Improvement of security and scalability for IoT network using SD-VPN, NOMS 2018-2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium, pp. 1-5, (2018); Wibowo B., Alaydrus M., Smart Home Security Analysis Using Arduino Based Virtual Private Network, 2019 Fourth International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC), pp. 1-4, (2019); Fan J., Wang Z., Li C., Design and Implementation of IoT Gateway Security System, 2019 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacturing (AIAM), pp. 156-162, (2019); Aqun Z., Yuan Y., Yi J., Guanqun G., Research on tunneling techniques in virtual private networks, WCC 2000-ICCT 2000. 2000 International Conference on Communication Technology Proceedings (Cat.

Indeed, IoT devices are extensively employed in a wide range of applications, including healthcare field and home automation. These objects are equipped with communication capabilities and can exchange data over the Internet. In recent times, the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge of growth and transformation. The integration of IoT-enabled devices has revolutionized remote monitoring in healthcare, empowering healthcare providers to keep their patients safe and healthy while delivering exceptional care. On the other hand, the home automation system is becoming increasingly popular due to its many benefits, which involve remotely monitoring and controlling household appliances. In fact, the main challenges faced by home automation systems are poor manageability, rigidity, difficulty in achieving security, and high ownership costs. As the internet and its applications continue to grow, there is enormous potential for remotely accessing, controlling and monitoring network-enabled devices. With this context in mind, the objective of this project is to develop two IoT-based models. These models are based on Arduino and Raspberry pi boards, cloud, Bluetooth and ZigBee protocols. The first model is an IoT healthcare system that employs various sensors to collect heart rate and motion data. The second model is a home automation system that utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels, a MQ2 sensor to detect gas leaks, and an ultrasonic sensor to control the garage door's opening and closing. Both systems are built around an Arduino or a Raspberry pi microcontrollers integrated with an Android mobile application to process and transmit data via Bluetooth or Zigbee ensuring that the mobile app receives real-time updates. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Android;

The most pressing bottleneck of running algorithms in IoT devices is the availability of low computation resources. The state-of-the-art algorithms which work significantly well in high-end computing unit more often fail to operate in IoT devices like Raspberry pi. This work targets design of a face authenticated door-lock security system in Raspberry pi and, therefore, evaluates the performance of conventional face detection and recognition models. The local binary pattern histogram (LBPH), eigenface and fisherface algorithms are considered for evaluation. The evaluation analyzes the accuracy of a model in detecting human faces, its computation time and vulnerability to photo hacking while implemented in Raspberry pi platform. It covers a large number of stored faces and the cases of variation in angle and illumination in the face image. The python and c++ bindings to the opencv framework are considered to create a fully functional face recognition system hardware. © 2020 IEEE.","door-lock; eigen-face; Face recognition; fisherface; IoT; LBPH; Raspberry pi","Automation; Availability; C++ (programming language); IoT; Locks (fasteners); Personal computing; Security systems; VLSI circuits; Computation resources; Face detection and recognition; Face recognition schemes; Face recognition systems; High end computing; IoT; Local binary patterns; State-of-the-art algorithms; Face recognition","","","","","","","Li X., Lee K.-J., Touba N.A., Chapter 6-test compression, Vlsi Test Principles and Architectures, pp. 341-396, (2006); Breuer M.A., Intelligible test techniques to support error-tolerance, 13th Asian Test Symposium, pp. 386-393, (2004); Wali I., Traiola M., Virazel A., Girard P., Barbareschi M., Bosio A., Towards approximation during test of integrated circuits, 2017 Ieee 20th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (Ddecs), pp. 28-33, (2017); Wali I., Et al., Can we approximate the test of integrated circuits?, Workshop on Approximate Computing, (2017); Anghel L., Et al., Test and reliability in approximate computing, Journal of Electronic Testing, (2018); Traiola M., Et al., Testing approximate digital circuits: Challenges and opportunities, LAmTS, (2018); Traiola M., Et al., On the comparison of different atpg approaches for approximate integrated circuits, Ddecs, (2018); Gebregiorgis A., Tahoori M.B., Test pattern generation for approximate circuits based on boolean satisfiability, 2019 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (Date), pp. 1028-1033, (2019); Traiola M., Virazel A., Girard P., Barbareschi M., Bosio A., A test pattern generation technique for approximate circuits based on an ilp-formulated pattern selection procedure, Ieee Transactions on Nanotechnology, 18, pp. 849-857, (2019); Jiang Z., Gupta S.K., An atpg for threshold testing: Obtaining acceptable yield in future processes, Proceedings.

Moreover, there is a noticeable increase in homes equipped with renewable energy sources (RESs), where the coordination of loads and generation can achieve extra savings and minimize peak loads. In this paper, a solar-powered smart home with optimal energy management is designed in an affordable and secure manner, allowing the owner to control the home from remote and local sites using their smartphones and PCs. The Raspberry Pi 4 B is used as the brain of the proposed smart home automation management system (HAMS). It is used to collect the data from the existing sensors and store them, and then take the decision. The home is monitored using a graphical interface that monitors room temperature, humidity, smoke, and lighting through a set of sensors, as well as PIR sensors to monitor the people movement. This action enables remote control of all home appliances in a safe and emission-free manner. This target is reached using Cayenne, which is an IoT platform, in addition to building some codes related to some appliances and sensors not supported in Cayenne from scratch. Convenience for people with disabilities is considered by using the Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa) to control home appliances and the charging point by voice, implementing the associated code for connecting the Raspberry pi with Alexa from scratch, and simulating the system on LabVIEW. To reach the optimal operation and reduce the operating costs, an optimization framework for the home energy management system (HEMS) is proposed. The operating costs for the day amounted to approximately 16.039 €. There is a decrease in the operating costs by about 23.13%. The consumption decreased after using the smart HAMS by 18.161 kWh. The results of the optimization also show that the least area that can be used to install solar panels to produce the desired energy with the lowest cost is about 118.1039 m2, which is about 23.62% of the total surface area of the home in which the study was conducted. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of automation, security, safety, and low operating costs. © 2022 by the authors.","home automation system (HAS); LabVIEW; raspberry pi 4 B; smart home energy management; solar system; Z-Wave","Cayenne; French Guiana; alternative energy; automation; brain; energy management; optimization; solar system; surface area","","","","","","","Elkholy M.H., Metwally H., Farahat M.A., Nasser M., Senjyu T., Lotfy M.E., Dynamic centralized control and intelligent load management system of a remote residential building with V2H technology, J.

The major challenge in implementing the algorithms on IoT devices is a lack of computational power. The major challenge in implementing the algorithms on IoT devices is a lack of computational power. The state-of-the-art methods run successfully in high-end computing units, are typically not used in Raspberry pi, considered as an IoT device. This paper aims to design an authorized door lock system using the framework Raspberry pi. Instead of Euclidean distance-based similarity measure between the test and the trained face images, here for face identification the pretrained FACENET model is used that reduces the false cases. In the current approach, Haar-Cascade is used to detect the faces and next we train the fully connected layers on the collected facial embeddings of FACENET. The proposed Haar-Cascade FACENET Fully Connected Face Authentication (HFFCFA) model eliminates the faults which occur in the Euclidean-based approach, thus reducing false positive and false negative cases. The network model works perfectly together with the Raspberry Pi pipeline for face recognition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep learning; Door-lock system; Face recognition; HFFCFA; IoT; Raspberry pi","","","","","","","","Bhoi A., Et al., IoT-IIRS: IoT based intelligent-irrigation recommendation system using machine learning approach for efficient water usage, Peerj Comput.

The practical problems for IoT and IIoT components compatibility as well as cloud independence, are discussed too. The authors mostly favor open-source and cloud-free solutions for Smart Home and established commercial platforms for Smart Office with advanced security, as shown in the presented case studies. Blockchaining of IoT and IIoT contributes to the compulsoriness and commitment in the decentralized world of “smart things” at home and in office rooms. However, secured smart devices can only be achieved with the combination of known crypto-technologies. Through a step-by-step provision of different blockchain-based platforms, the declared protection goals can be reached. The main features of the functioning of IoT, Edge, and Cloud computing technologies are considered. An intelligent IoT system has been developed to collect data from a specific location and transmit it to an Edge device for on-site processing. This data will be transferred to the cloud system or further processing or remote management, if needed. The solution aims to reduce the cost of maintaining the system by reducing the volume of messages that are sent to the cloud platform, which is quite expensive and a weighty factor in using the system, to provide remote management without buying a fixed server part. An algorithm for predicting temperature values in the server room of a smart office has been proposed and implemented in a designed IoT system based on Raspberry Pi 4 using an LSTM model. Using this solution in practice will increase the reliability of server equipment by early prediction, warning, and taking measures in case of temperature rise. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; CIDN; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air-conditioning); IoT and IIoT; LSTM; Radio and contactless sensing; Smart home; Smart office; Smart technologies","","","","","","","","Zaigham M., Fog Computing: Concepts, Frameworks and Technologies, (2017); Klymash M., Luntovskyy A., Beshley M., Future intent-based networking: on the qos robust and energy efficient heterogeneous software-defined networks, XXI, (2022); Luntovskyy A., Guetter D., Highly-Distributed Systems: IoT, Robotics, Mobile Apps, Energy Efficiency, Security, 321, (2022); Luntovskyy A., Spillner J., Architectural Transformations in Network Services and Distributed Systems: Current Technologies, Standards and Research Results in Advanced (mobile) Networks, (2017); Luntovskyy A., Zobjack T., Secured and blockchained IoT, 2021 International Conference on Information and Digital Technologies (IDT), pp. 1-10, (2021); Luntovskyy A., Zobjack T., Shubyn B., Klymash M., Energy efficiency and security for IoT scenarios via WSN, RFID and NFC, 2021 IEEE 5th International Conference on Information and Telecommunication Technologies and Radio Electronics (UkrMiCo), pp. 1-6, (2021); Luntovskyy A., Shubyn B., Energy efficiency for IoT, Springer LNCS series “Reliability Engineering and Computational Intelligence - Studies Comp.

Hackers exploit vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and insecure, unencrypted data transfer to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Sensible deployment of conventional security measures is jeopardized by the heterogeneity and resource constraints of smart devices. This article presents a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of IoT devices to detect anomalous behavior in smart home environments. We prototype a smart camera using Raspberry Pi and gather power traces for normal activity. Furthermore, we model DDoS attacks on the experimental setup and generate attack traces of power consumption. Besides, we compare the performances of several machine learning models for accurate prediction of the presence of anomalies. A deep feed-forward neural network model achieves an accuracy of 99.2% compared to other models. Empirical evaluations of the proposed concept affirm that power consumption is a promising parameter in detecting anomalies in smart home. The proposed method is suitable for smart home as it does not impose additional overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; IoT; Power consumption; Smart home","Automation; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Denial-of-service attack; Electric power utilization; Network security; Personal computing; Anomaly detection; Cyber-attacks; Deep learning; Denialof- service attacks; Distributed denial of service; Information age; Security measure; Smart devices; smart home; Weak passwords; IoT","","","","","Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity, (MEITY-PHD-2635)","K.

With millions of interconnected devices over the internet, IoT is currently running into its monumental security and centralization issues that can be resolved using Blockchain. This paper aims to demonstrate the use of a smart contract on a private Ethereum Blockchain (also known as permission less Blockchain) to check whether a user holds enough tokens to utilize a service. Private in this context implies a private instance of the Ethereum implementation in which we make use of the same security and principles of the Ethereum main chain on a personal network of connected IoT devices which improves the overall privacy and security of the system than the traditional schemes. The proposed model consists of a target IoT device controlled by a Raspberry Pi, running a client application that makes decisions based on the state of the smart contract. With this environment, we are able to achieve the following goals: (1) no data leaves the private network (2) all services are employed with transparency and accountability (3) only registered devices can issue requests for using a service. Although the demonstration is made on a home network, the model presented in this paper can be utilized in commercial environments where any service can be availed from a wide array of smart devices through a mobile application. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Ethereum; Home automation systems; IoT; IoT applications; IoT Security","Blockchain; Ethereum; Home networks; Network security; Personal communication systems; Client applications; IoT; Main chains; Mobile applications; Personal networks; Privacy and security; Private networks; Smart devices; IoT","","","","","","","Ali J., Ali T., Musa S., Zahrani A., Towards Secure Iot Communication with Smart Contracts in a Blockchain Infrastructure, (2020); Ali A., Zhu Y., Chen Q., Et al., Leveraging spatio-Temporal patterns for predicting citywide traffic crowd flows using deep hybrid neural networks, Proc Int Conf Parallel Distrib Syst - ICPADS 2019-December, pp. 125-132, (2019); Ethereum Blockchain for Securing the IoT: Practical Implementation and Performance Evaluation. 2019 Int Conf Cyber Secur Prot Digit Serv Cyber Secur, 2019, pp. 1-5, (2019); Asadullah M., Raza A., An overview of home automation systems, 2Nd Int Conf Robot Artif Intell ICRAI, pp. 27-31, (2016); Ashari A., Shouran Z., Kuntoro Priyambodo T., IoT of smart home: privacy and security, Artic Int J Comput Appl, 182, pp. 975-8887, (2019); Atlam H.F., Wills G.B., Technical Aspects of Blockchain and Iot, (2019); Aung Y.N., Tantidham T., Review of Ethereum: Smart home case study, Proceeding 2017 2Nd Int Conf Inf Technol INCIT 2017 2018-Janua:1–4, (2017); A next-generation smart contract and decentralized application platform, White Paper, 3, 37, (2014); Chen H., Pendleton M., Njilla L., Xu S., 67 A Survey on Ethereum systems security: Vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses, ACM Comput Surv, 53, (2020); Cheng J., Xie L., Tang X., Et al., A survey of security threats and defense on Blockchain, Multimed Tools Appl, (2020); Dorri A., Kanhere S.S., Jurdak R., Gauravaram P., Blockchain for Iot Security and Privacy: The Case Study of a Smart Home. 2017 IEEE Int Conf Pervasive Comput Commun Work Percom Work, 2017, pp. 618-623, (2017); Dorri A., Kanhere S.S., Jurdak R., Gauravaram P., LSB: A Lightweight Scalable Blockchain for IoT security and anonymity, J Parallel Distrib Comput, 134, pp. 180-197, (2019); Fakhri D., Mutijarsa K., ISESD 2018 - Int Symp Electron Smart Devices Smart Devices Big Data Anal Mach Learn, (2019); Hassija V., Chamola V., Saxena V., Et al., A survey on IoT Security: application areas, security threats, and solution architectures, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 82721-82743, (2019); Hossain S., Waheed S., Rahman Z., Et al., Blockchain for the Security of IoT: A Smart Home Use Case Using Ethereum, (2020); Hsu H.T., Jong G.J., Chen J.H., Jhe C.G., Improve IoT security system of smart-home by using support vector machine, IEEE 4Th Int Conf Comput Commun Syst ICCCS, pp. 674-677, (2019); Huh S., Cho S., Kim S., Managing IoT devices using blockchain platform, Int Conf Adv Commun Technol ICACT, pp. 464-467, (2017); Jeyanthi N., Thandeeswaran R., Global I.G.I., Security Breaches and Threat Prevention in the IoT.

Owing to the numerous benefits brought about by smart home, research on the topic has been increasing at an exponential rate, bringing quality properties such as security, usability, reliability, and others. Despite their various advantages, smart home have not been in a positive spotlight regarding security and reliability. The main reason that people are hesitant towards adopting an implemented intelligent system at their domicile is due to the lack of trust they allocate to the electronics. As such, this paper provides insights on an innovative and low-cost smart home monitoring system named RaspiMonitor. While the central aim of the system is to offer a robust smart home architecture which discreetly caters for the safety and security of its environment, it also helps in reducing energy wastage. The RaspiMonitor was carefully designed using dynamic web-based services in addition to an evaluation which quantified its usability and acceptance through the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with 6 constructs. Results in principle portray acceptance of the system with a mean score of 4.47. This indicates that a robust hardware and software architecture such as the RaspiMonitor is useful, convenient, and easy to use. © 2022 IEEE.","Intelligent Environments; Internet-of-Things; Raspberry Pi; RaspiMonitor; Smart Home; Technology Acceptance","Automation; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Monitoring; Exponential rates; Home monitoring systems; Intelligent environment; Quality properties; Raspberry pi; Raspimonitor; Security usabilities; smart home; Technological infrastructure; Technology acceptance; IoT","","","","","","","Shin J., Park Y., Lee D., Who will be smart home users?

However, many of the connected devices particularly in smart home are the target of attacks that try to exploit security vulnerabilities such as hard-coded passwords and insecure data transfer. Recent studies show that there is a considerable surge in the number of phishing attacks targeting smart home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many of the existing user authentication protocols in the literature incur additional computational overhead and need to be made more resilient to smart home targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight and privacy-preserving remote user authentication protocol for securing smart home applications. Our approach is based on Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) to make our protocol resilient to smart home attacks such as smartphone capture attacks and phishing attacks. In addition, the lightweight nature of our solution is suitable for deployment on heterogeneous and resource constrained IoT devices. Besides, we leverage geometric secret sharing for establishing mutual authentication among the participating entities. We validate the security of the proposed protocol using the AVISPA formal verification tool and prototype it on a Raspberry Pi to analyze the power consumption. Finally, a comparison with existing schemes reveals that our scheme incurs a 20% reduction in communication overhead on smart devices. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is usable as it absolves users from memorizing passwords and carrying smart cards.  © 2013 IEEE.","Authentication protocol; geometric secret sharing; IoT; PRNU; protocol resiliency; smart home","Authentication; Automation; Computation theory; Data privacy; Data transfer; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Internet protocols; Smart cards; Authentication protocols; Geometric secret sharing; Nonuniformity; Photo response non-uniformity; Photoresponses; Protocol resiliency; Secret-sharing; Security; smart home; Cryptography","","","","","Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","The work of K.

The IoT applications can be found in various fields of our life, such as smart home, health care, smart building, and etc. In all these applications, the data collected from the real world are transmitted through the Internet; therefore, these data have become a target of many attacks and hackers. Hence, a secure communication must be provided to protect the transmitted data from unauthorized access. This paper focuses on designing a secure IoT system to protect the sensing data. In this system, the security is provided by the use of Lightweight AES encryption algorithm to encrypt the data received from physical environment. The hardware used in this proposal is the Raspberry Pi 3 model B and two types of sensors. The LAES algorithm was embedded inside the Raspberry in order to protect the sensing data, that come from sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi, before sending them through the network. The analysis results show that the proposed IoT security system consumes less time in encryption/decryption and has high throughput when compared with others from related work. Its throughput is higher in about 19.24% than the value reported for one system in the related studies. © 2021 University of Baghdad-College of Science.

It is used to restrict access to a system, application, or service to only those users who have the authorization to use the system or device. Because of increased computing power, modern passwords must be very long and complicated, which will make them hard to remember. Some research studies show that it is easier for people to remember visual passwords instead of textual ones. Therefore, this research aims to enhance the authentication process's security using the graphical pattern unlock approach on Raspberry Pi. The grid size of 5 × 5 was selected in the implementation, as it provides the tradeoff between security strength and an easy pattern to remember. The proposed system could be connected to the smart home system, which can enhance their security. Prototype validation revealed that the prototype is working as intended, and the authentication process took around 1.2 s to complete. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Graphical pattern; Raspberry Pi; Security enhancement; Smart home","Automation; Graphic methods; Computing power; Graphical patterns; Prototype development; Research studies; Security mechanism; Security strengths; Smart-home system; Visual passwords; Authentication","","","","","International Islamic University; UIN Sunan Gunung Djati; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/UIAM/02/4, FRGS19–076-0684); University of New South Wales, UNSW; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Acknowledgments.

In the elderly population, accidental fall is a common cause of injury due to the weakness or any other disease such as high temperature and blood pressure. Moreover, in developing countries, the use of natural gas for older adults is widespread for room heating. The use of a gas heater in a room can be hazardous, especially at night and it has reportedly said to turn OFF the gas heater while going to sleep. However, it is ignored quite often that results in many deaths not only to the elderly but to all age groups. To cope with these issues and to provide a safer environment, especially to the older people where the caretaker can be informed well on-time, a raspberry Pi assisted cost-effective safety system is proposed. The 3-axis accelerometer of gas and flame sensors are used to detect an event when accidental fall occurs precisely, or any gas leakage or flame is detected. The caretaker will be informed using a mobile app or text alert to take action immediately. Results demonstrate that the modules for fall and gas/open flame detection accurately detected true events by 92% and 95% respectively. The primary purpose of the proposed system is to provide a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient method for the safety of the elderly population.  © 2020 IEEE.","Fall detection; Raspberry Pi; Safety system; Smart home","Automation; Blood pressure; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Gas heating; Safety engineering; Security systems; 3-axis accelerometer; Accidental falls; Cost effective; Elderly people; Elderly populations; Flame detection; Flame sensors; High temperature; Gases","","","","","Robotics and Internet-of-Things Lab in Prince Sultan University","This work is supported by the Robotics and Internet-of-Things Lab in Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In brief, Domotics allows users to monitor and control various devices/appliances within a smart home. From entertainment to security, several devices have become more accessible. However, the underlying network infrastructure in this environment has remained the same despite the recent revolution brought about by Software-Defined Networking (SDN).For the past decade, SDN has shown great potential for providing more network flexibility and programmability in both the control and data plane. However, most of the use cases are thought for enterprise and Data-Center Networks, while its application closer to the end-users (i.e., Home environments) is still under-exploited. Therefore, this research introduces the Network Operations for Domotics (NeO-Domotics) notion, which uses Next-Generation SDN components (e.g., P4, NG-SDN interfaces) in the context of Home Automation. This paper describes the overall design and showcases preliminary use cases using a Raspberry Pi.  © 2023 IEEE.","Domotics; P4; Raspberry Pi; SDN","Domotics; Home automation; Monitor and control; Network flexibility; Network infrastructure; Network operations; Raspberry pi; smart home; Software-defined networkings; Underlying networks; Automation","","","","","","","NG-SDN; Tawfik M., Et al., IoT-Based Middleware Against Cyber-Attacks on smart home using Software-Defined Networking and Deep Learning, Proc. 2nd Int.

Face recognition powered by IoT is becoming more popular because it is dependable and simple to use. To prevent algorithmic errors and produce enhanced accuracy than existing systems, our system employs a facial recognition door lock with the integration of three algorithms on a single camera. The system detects unauthorized people near the entrance and notifies the user via a mobile app. For hardware communication, we used a camera module, a Raspberry PI, passive infrared motion sensors, and wireless internet access. The Python and OpenCV libraries are used in the algorithm's development. When the motion sensor detects activity in front of the door, the camera is activated, and the system gathers camera feeds and sends the images to three algorithms for analysis. If any two or all of the algorithm's results match the image in the database, the door unlocks; otherwise, it remains locked. The development of this system aims to enhance accuracy by combining three algorithms and to provide consumers with data about what is happening in front of their home via a smart door lock system. © 2023 IEEE.","Enhanced Result; Ensemble Learning; Integrating Algorithms; Motion Detection; Remote Access; Smart Door Lock","Cameras; Face recognition; IoT; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Motion analysis; Critical component; Enhanced result; Ensemble learning; Integrating algorithm; Lock system; Machine learning algorithms; Motion detection; Remote access; Smart door lock; Smart doors; Locks (fasteners)","","","","","","","Pandit V., Majgaonkar P., Meher P., Sapaliga S., Bojewar S., Intelligent Security Lock, Proceedings of the International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICEI), (2018); Waseem M., Ali Khowaja S., Kumar Ayyasamy R., Bashir F., Face Recognition for Smart Door Lock System using Hierarchical Network, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Intelligence (ICCI), (2020); Patel J., Anand S., Luthra R., Image-Based Smart Surveillance and Remote Door Lock Switching System for Homes, Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Trends in Advanced Computing, 165, pp. 624-630, (2019); Sagar D., Narasimha M.K.R., Development and Simulation Analysis of a Robust Face Recognition Based Smart Locking System, Proceedings of Innovations in Electronics and Communication Engineering, 33, (2018); Khalimov R., Rakhimbayeva Z., Shokayev A., Kamalov B., Ali M.H., Development of Intelligent Door Locking System Based on Face Recognition Technology, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, (2020); Nag A., Nikhilendra J.N., Kalmath M., IoT based door access control using Face recognition, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT), (2018); Jahnavi S., Nandini C., Smart Anti-Theft Door Locking System, (2019); Andreas C.R.A., Wiratama Putra H., Hanafiaha N., Surjarwo S., Wibisuryab A., Door Security System for Home Monitoring Based on ESP32, Proceedings of the 4th International SConference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI), 157, pp. 673-682, (2019); Aman F., Anitha C., Motion Sensing and Image Capturing based Smart Door System on Android Platform, Proceedings of the International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS), (2018); Pawar S., Kithani V., Ahuja S., Sahu S., Smart Home Security using IoT and Face Recognition, Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Computing Communication Control and Automation (ICCUBEA), (2019); Sajjad, Et al., Raspberry Pi helped outward appearance recognition system for shrewd security in law-Authorization administrations, Information Sciences, 479, pp. 416-431, (2019); Kushwaha V., Singh M., Singh R., Vatsa M., Ratha N., Chellappa R., Disguised faces in the wild, Proceedings of the Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 1-9, (2018); Peng Z., Kato T., Takahashi H., Kinoshita T., Intelligent home security system using agent-based IoT devices, Ieee 4th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE), (2015); Ha I., Security and Usability Improvement on a Digital Door Lock System based on IoT, International Journal of Security and Its Applications, 9, 8, (2015)","P.

However, CCTV is less effective because it requires high bandwidth & storage and cannot provide notifications. Therefore, a technology called the IoT appears so that CCTV or webcam can work together with sensors to detect the presence of intruders and provide notifications. This study proposes a system that detects intruders and sends notifications to homeowner regardless of time and place. This system is usually referred to as a smart home security system. The authors proposed the smart home security system for intruder detection using YOLO V3 algorithm. This research is implemented using magnetic door sensor and alarm or buzzer and a webcam connected to Raspberry Pi 3B+. This proposed system will send notifications using telegram. We have implemented the proposed system and found the result that most accurate intruder detector is the YOLO V3 algorithm with an accuracy of 98.58%. © 2023, ICIC International.

The traditional security such as Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras are very easy to break and lead to theft. And moreover, the installation cost of the security systems is costlier. To overcome these problems, we are presenting IoT based solution where we can setup a smart security system. In this paper, we are proposing the system with the help of face detection and face recognition algorithms to secure our home which gives us the facility of entire surveillance of our buildings remotely and take appropriate action if anything goes wrong. The Camera Serial Interface (CSI) is attached to the Raspberry PI which detects presence of person using Face detection and recognition algorithms. The multiple Raspberry PIs attached in different areas of our buildings are connected to the main Raspberry PI which acts as hub module. If the person is identified as unknown, the information is sent to Hub module which in turn sends the alert message and live video streaming to the user using an app which we developed.  © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Face detection; Face recognition; IOT; Mobile face net algorithm; Native app development; Smart security system; SSD algorithm","","","","","","","","Zhang C., Xiao Y., Lin J., Philip Chen C.L., Liu W., Tong Y., 3-D Deconvolutional Networks for the Unsupervised Representation Learning of Human Motions, (2020); Sen Poh G., Gope P., Ning J., Priv Home: Privacy Preserving Authenticated Communication in Smart Home Environment, 99, 99, (2019); Ding C., Hong H., Zou Y., Chu H., Zhu X., Fioranelli F., Le Kernec J., Li C., Continuous Human Motion Recognition with A Dynamic Range-Doppler Trajectory Method Based on FMCW Radar, 57, 9, (2019); Samet Taspinar B., Mohanty M., Memon N., PRNU-Based Camera Attribution from Multiple Sea Carved Images, 20, 5, (2017); Lee Y., Hsiao W., Huang C., Chou S.T., An Integrated Cloud-Based Smart Home Management System with Community Hierarchy, pp. 2162-237X, (2016)","G.

In voice password and biometric based authentication door locking system, authentication using the unique identification like biometric and voice recognition plays a vital role to provide high level of security. The finger ridges of individual do not match with any other finger ridges and an individual's voice cannot be impersonated with accuracy.This paper proposes a smart voice password and biometric based security system for door locking in smart home. To enhance the security, in place of conventional door locking system, a finger print sensor along with a micro phone are used to authenticate, i.e. to lock and unlock the doors [1]. The data base will maintain the data of the persons who tried to access the door. The entire system is controlled by the Raspberry pi 3 B+ processor. PIWHO soft ware is used for the purpose of voice recognition. Door access may be provided to the registered users based on his voice pass word and thumb impression. Door will be opened only when both the factors are satisfied, otherwise buzzer will be activated and the authorized person will receive an SMS alert message.  © 2021 IEEE.","Finger print sensor; PIWHO; Raspberry Pi-3 B+ processor","Automation; Biometrics; Intelligent buildings; Security systems; Speech recognition; Biometric based authentication; Finger print; Finger print sensor; Home work; Password-based authentication; PIWHO; Raspberry pi-3 B+ processor; smart home; Unique identifications; Work place; Authentication","","","","","","","Gyanendra K.V., Tripathi P., A digital security system with door lock system, International Journal of Computer Application, 5, 11, pp. 6-8, (2010); Madhusudan M., Sankaraiah, Implementation of automated door unlocking and security system, International Journal of Computer Applications, pp. 5-8, (2015); Yuan Y., Relationship between internetof things and consumer electronics, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, (2012); Chowdary A., Revolutionin authentication process by using biometrics, International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems, pp. 36-41, (2011); Nehete P.R., Chaudhari J.P., Pachpande S.R., Rane K.P., Literature survey on door lock security systems, International Journal of Computer Applications, 153, 2, pp. 13-18, (2016); Fernando L.P., Personal authentication through biometric technologies, Proceedings 2002 IEEE 4th International Workshop on Networked Appliances (Cat No. 02EX525), Gaithersburg, MD, pp. 57-66, (2002); Cappelli R., Lumini A., Maio D., Maltoni D., Fingerprint image reconstruction from standard templates, IEEE Trans.

The security of their lives and possessions is critical. The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a smart light control and intruder detection system using Raspberry Pi based on the IoT. The proposed prototype supports Wi-Fi and 4G mobile connections in a home or outdoor environment. The methodology used in this study is for manual control of on-off lights and detection of an intruder with a range of response times, including low, medium, and high response delays (1, 2.5, and 5 seconds). The testing results compare the Average Response Time and the Average Effectiveness Response Time for mobile connections over 4G and Wi-Fi. The results support the on-off lights, with response accuracy rates of 78 percent, 84 percent, and 100 percent for Thai and English voice commands on Google Assistance and the Blynk mobile application, respectively. As a result, the research examines the response time for various environments with varying levels of mobile communication. The proposed system has designed and evaluated a prototype of smart light control and intruder detection using the IoT.

However, unlike traditional network security, where the emphasis is given on the core network, IoT networks are mostly investigated from the data stand-point. Lightweight data transmission protocols, such as Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), are often deployed for data-sharing and device authentication due to limited onboard resources. This paper presents the MQTT protocol's security vulnerabilities by incorporating Elliptic Curve Cryptography-based (ECC-based) security to improve confidentiality issues. We used commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) devices such as Raspberry Pi to build a simplified network topology that connects IoT devices in our smart home laboratory. The results illustrate an ECC-based security application in confidentiality increase of 70.65% from 29.35% in time parameter during publish/subscribe communication protocol for the smart home. © 2022 IEEE.","ECC-based security; IoT; MQTT; Smart Home","Geometry; IoT; Network security; Public key cryptography; Curve cryptography; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography-based security; Home-application; IoT; Message queue telemetry transport; Message queues; Research topics; smart home; Transport systems; Automation","","","","","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, (FRGS/1/2020/TK0/USM/02/1); Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for providing the research grant, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS - Grant No: FRGS/1/2020/TK0/USM/02/1) that helped to carry out this research.","MQTT V3.11, Protocol Specification, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Eurotech; Shelby Z., RFC-7959 Block-Wise Transfers in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), (2016); Fysarakis K., Askoxylakis I., Soultatos O., Papaefstathiou I., Which IoT Protocol?

To contain the infectious disease, many countries have quarantined their citizens for several weeks to months and even suspended most economic activities. To track the movements of residents, the governments of many states have adopted various novel technologies. Connecting billions of sensors and devices over the Internet, the so-called IoT, has been used for outbreak control. However, these technologies also pose serious privacy risks and security concerns with regards to data transmission and storage. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system to provide the secure management of home quarantine. The privacy and security attributes for various events are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. To demonstrate the application of the system, we provide a case study in an IoT system with a desktop computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and the Ethereum smart contract platform. The obtained results prove its ability to satisfy security, efficiency, and low-cost requirements. © 2020 by the authors.

Several relevant issues have been tested such as device management patterns and some security concerns. The getting started issues of this technology have been emphasized. These include development machine compatibility, edge device choosing decisions, containers engine, and proper IDE for development. An emulated smart home scenario with five virtual sensor devices hosted by a Raspberry Pi edge device has been used as a case study to investigate the properties of the system. We have studied the results coming from applying the newly developed configuration management patterns to set or modify some environment variables remotely and inside the edge node. Furthermore, various operational cases have been studied to experimentally verify the difference when enabling edge analytics and when sending raw readings to the cloud. Indeed, the case of using symmetric encryption to increase the security aspects of the application has been studied and experimentally verified. © 2020 IEEE.","Azure IoT; device management patterns; edge computing; Raspberry pi; smart home","Ambient intelligence; Automation; Cryptography; Decision support systems; Edge computing; Intelligent buildings; Windows operating system; Configuration management; Device management; Edge nodes; MicroSoft; Security aspects; smart home; Symmetric encryption; Virtual sensor; IoT","","","","","","","Apthorpe N., Reisman D., Feamster N., A Smart Home Is No Castle: Privacy Vulnerabilities of Encrypted IoT Traffic, (2017); Zeng J., Li C., Zhang L.-J., A face recognition system based on cloud computing and ai edge for iot, EDGE 2018 LNCS 10973 Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 91-98, (2018); Jensen D., Beginning Azure IoT Edge Computing: Extending the Cloud to the Intelligent Edge, (2019); Shi W., Cao J., Zhang Q., Li Y., Xu L., Edge computing: Vision and challenges, IEEE IoT Journal, 3, 5, pp. 637-646, (2016); Shehab A., Al-Janabi S., Edge computing: Review and future directions, REVISTA AUS Journal, Special Issue, 262, pp. 368-380, (2019); Dolui K., Datta S.K., Comparison of edge computing implementations: Fog computing, cloudlet and mobile edge computing, The Global IoT Summit (GIoTS), pp. 1-6, (2017); Constant N., An Intelligent Fog Centric Network for IoT-driven Smart Communities, (2017); Satyanarayanan M., The emergence of edge computing, Computer, IEEE Computer Society, 50, 1, pp. 30-39, (2017); Bragadeesh S.A., Arumugam U., A conceptual framework for security and privacy in edge computing, Edge Computing, EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing, pp. 173-186, (2019); Tri D.N., Ahsan Kazami S.M., Choong S.H., A dynamic algorithm for computational offloading in fog computing, Proceedings of Korea Computer Conference, pp. 510-512, (2016); Neto J.L.D., Yu S.-Y., Macedo D.F., Nogueira J.-M., Langar R., ULOOF: A user-level online offloading framework for mobile edge computing, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 17, 11, pp. 2660-2674, (2018); Sheng J., Hu J., Teng X., Wang B., Pan X., Computation offloading strategy in mobile edge computing, Information, 10, 6, (2019); Lin L., Liao X., Jin H., Li P., Computation offloading toward edge computing, Proceedings of the IEEE, 107, 8, pp. 1584-1607, (2019); Rostrup P.N., A Distributed-to-centralized Architectural Model for Smart City Applications and Services through Container Orchestration, (2019); Babou C.S.M., Fall D., Kashihara S., Niang I., Kadobayashi Y., Home edge computing (hec): Design of a new edge computing technology for achieving ultra-low latency, EDGE 2018, LNCS 10973, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 3-17, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2020 International Conference on Decision Aid Sciences and Application, DASA 2020","7 November 2020 through 9 November 2020","Virtual, Sakheer","166557","","978-172819677-0","","","English","Int.

Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the smart home system using the IoT. Furthermore, signature recognition and verification can play essential roles in finance, banking, home system, insurance, and others. This paper's main objective is to design and implement a signature recognition system on a single board computer, i.e., Raspberry Pi 3 equipped with an LCD touchscreen. First, the acquired signature image was cropped and resized. Next, a binary image was extracted as features to train the artificial neural network (ANN). The trained ANN was used to classify the input signature to determine whether the signature is genuine or forged.

However, this integration of diverse smart devices has brought significant cybersecurity challenges. Detecting and analyzing abnormal network packets have become paramount, signifying potential intrusions, malicious activities, or system errors and ensuring the security and stability of smart home systems. Machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Random Forests, have shown promise in addressing these challenges. However, most research has concentrated on anomaly detection rather than malicious activity in smart home. The vast datasets collected from various scenarios pose methodological and algorithmic challenges for applying machine learning techniques. To fill these research gaps, our study introduces traditional machine-learning methods for detecting abnormal network packets in smart home using the IoT-23 dataset. It involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features, and training various machine learning models. The correlation matrix helps validate the feature selection of the best models based on performance metrics like precision, F1-score, recall, accuracy ratio, training score, and training time cost. Additionally, the study classifies 12 types of malicious malware across different machine learning models, considering performance within the context of smart home devices. This study implements real-time anomaly detection on the Raspberry Pi using packet captures and Zeek flowmeter methods. The findings contribute insights into models suitable for smart home security. In addition, our research enhances the understanding and application of machine learning methods for bolstering security in smart home.  © 2023 ACM.","Anomaly Detection; Cybersecurity; IoT-23 Dataset; Machine Learning; smart home","Anomaly detection; Automation; Convolutional neural networks; Cybersecurity; IoT; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Recurrent neural networks; Support vector machines; Anomaly detection; Cyber security; IoT-23 dataset; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Malicious activities; Network packets; smart home; Decision trees","","","","","","","Ali Ahmed A., Ali Ahmed W., An effective multifactor authentication mechanism based on combiners of hash function over IoT, Sensors, 19, 17, (2019); Albawi S., Abed Mohammed T., Al-Zawi S., Understanding of a convolutional neural network, 2017 international conference on engineering and technology (ICET).

This is mainly because the IoT interacts directly with people's everyday lives in critical applications, such as in smart home and healthcare applications. IoT devices typically have a resource-constrained architecture, rendering them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Accordingly, smart devices and stored data need to be secured through lightweight and energy-efficient security solutions, which have been identified as the main challenge facing adoption of IoT systems. To address this problem, a disruptive technology (blockchain) has been foreseen by the industry and research community as being able to deliver secure, fast, reliable, and transparent solutions for IoT systems. Hence, this work investigates the adoption of lightweight blockchain technology, mainly as a method of securing IoT systems. Because hashing plays a major role in creating a robust blockchain structure, we select a number of different hash techniques to be executed on a Raspberry Pi device. In summation, this work provides a numerical study to evaluate the performance of well-known hash functions that can be used for lightweight blockchain-based IoT. © 2021 The Authors","Cybersecurity; Hash; IoT; Lightweight blockchain","Automation; Blockchain; Cybersecurity; Energy efficiency; Hash functions; Intelligent buildings; Block-chain; Comparatives studies; Critical applications; Cyber security; Hash; Health care application; Home-application; Internet of thing; Lightweight blockchain; smart home; IoT","","","","","","","Reyna A., Martin C., Chen J., Et al., On blockchain and its integration with IoT.

The primary system is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer and a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which has web and android and can be accessed via Wi-fi and the Internet. A wide range of sensors is attached to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which transmits data to the main Raspberry Pi 4 through MQTT. The system includes various smart home features and facilitates System Control functionalities, enabling users to control their home environment and efficiently operate the Raspberry Pi 4. The software is uniquely designed in a way that users can be well-informed about System health and load. Moreover, users can also manage each smart home feature separately so that no program can run in the system background independently. All these functionalities will ensure the system users' safety and security, save energy, and assist in avoiding accidents without requiring technical knowledge. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2023.","","Sustainable development; Domotics; Hardware components; Hardware/software; Primary systems; smart home; Smart-home system; Software solution; Systems architecture; WEB application; Web applications; Automation","","","","","","","Smart Home Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Product, by Protocol (Wireless Protocols, Wired Protocols), by Application (New Construction, Retrofit), by Region, and Segment Forecasts, 2022-2030, (2022); Venkatesh K., Hemaswathi S., Rajalingam B., IoT Based Home Automation Using Raspberry Pi, Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems, 10, 7, pp. 1721-1728, (2018); Oo Z.

The primary goal of Home automation is to provide pleasant, secure, efficient, and easy management or monitoring of home appliances, using sensors that save energy too. For controlling the home appliances, existing systems use Bluetooth, Zigbee, GSM Module, WLAN, or Internet Technology. Home automation systems have been further enhanced using Arduino, Node MCU, Raspberry Pi, and WIFI Module. When billions of devices are online and this data-rich world enabled by the IoT is fully operational, cloud computing won't be able to handle the workload. Every IoT sensor produces a significant amount of data. Data is promptly transferred to a central cloud database in cloud computing, where it is managed and stored. But occasionally, a response may be interrupted or delayed owing to a network error or a poor internet connection simply because the data centre is too far away from the device. This problem is solved by the use of edge computing, IoT device itself or the nearby node network is behind the data processing and can response in an exact manner if a specific action is needed. In the proposed paper a detailed review conducted regarding existing technologies and existing home automation system (HAS). With the same reference to IoT, new architecture needs to be developed and providing data security using the edge computing instead of Cloud Computing. © 2022 ACM.","Cloud Computing; Edge Computing; Home Automation System;

However, having these devices connected to the Internet may expose them to various risks malicious and suspicious attacks. In addition, after the device installation, these devices normally do not receive full security measurement, resulting in becoming the attacking and intruding targets. This research studies and focuses on the security threats in smart home networks by using Raspberry Pi which is low cost and portable. Our system, which is called PITI, performs hybrid detection by combining Snort IDS and behavior-based profile analysis together in order to efficiently detect malicious and suspicious traffic. The current version of PITI can alert anomaly traffic by showing a message on the screen and also alert by sounds. For the future work, PITI device should be developed into Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which can drop the suspicious packets and detect more type of attacks.  © 2020 IEEE.","cyber security; IoT; intrusion detection system; Raspberry Pi; smart home; Snort","Automation; IoT; Network security; Personal communication systems; IoT; Intruding targets; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion prevention systems; Research studies; Security measurement; Security threats; Ubiquitous technology; Intrusion detection","","","","","","","Double-Digit Growth Expected in the Smart Home Market, Says IDC, (2019); Cimpanu C., NASA Hacked because of Unauthorized Raspberry Pi Connected to Its Network, (2019); Chang Z., IoT device security-locking out risks and threats to smart home, Trend Micro Research, (2019); Top 10 IoT Vulnerabilities; Metasploit Framework; Ioulianou P., Vassilakis V., Moscholios I., Logothetis M.D., A signature-based intrusion detection system for the IoT, The Proceedings of Information and Communication Technology Forum (ICTF) 2018, (2018); Sforzin A., Marmol F.G., Conti M., Bohli J., RPiDS: Raspberry pi ids - A fruitful intrusion detection system for iot, 2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld), pp. 440-448, (2016); Kumar S.S., Kulothungan K., An anomaly behavior based detection and prevention of dos attack in iot environment, 2017 Ninth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC), pp. 287-292, (2017)","","","IEEE Computer Society","","11th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence, ICTC 2020","21 October 2020 through 23 October 2020","Jeju Island","166030","21621233","978-172816758-9","","","English","Int.

The application of face recognition systems can be applied to surveillance at home, workplaces, and campuses, accordingly. The problem with existing face recognition systems is that they either rely on the facial key points and landmarks or the face embeddings from FaceNet for the recognition process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical network (HN) framework which uses pre-trained architecture for recognizing faces followed by the validation from face embeddings using FaceNet. We also designed a real-time face recognition security door lock system connected with raspberry pi as an implication of the proposed method. The evaluation of the proposed work has been conducted on the dataset collected from 12 students from Faculty of Engineering and Technology, University of Sindh. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results over existing works. We also carried out a comparison on random faces acquired from the Internet to perform face recognition and results shows that the proposed HN framework is resilient to the randomly acquired faces.  © 2020 IEEE.","Deep Machine learning; Face Recognition; Raspberry pi; Security Door; Smart home","Embeddings; Engineering education; Intelligent computing; Locks (fasteners); Locks (on waterways); Network security; Engineering and technology; Face recognition systems; Hierarchical network; Human identification; Lock system; Real-time face recognition; Recognition process; Smart doors; Face recognition","","","","","","","Khowaja S., Shah S., Shah R., Shah A., Dc coefficients comparison based approach for fingerprint identification system, Sindh University Research Journal-Surj (Science Series), 47, 1; Anuj, The Importance of Security Systems, (2018); Chowdhury M., Access Control of Door and Home Security by Raspberry Pi through Internet, (2015); Prasade K., Et al., Face recognition based door locking system, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), (2018); Manjunatha R., Et al., Home security system and door access control based on face recognition, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), (2017); Khowaja S.A., Dahri K., Kumbhar M.A., Soomro A.M., Facial expression recognition using two-tier classification and its application to smart home automation system, 2015 International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET), pp. 1-6, (2015); Khowaja S.A., Yahya B.N., Lee S.L., Hierarchical classification method based on selective learning of slacked hierarchy for activity recognition systems, Expert Systems with Applications, 88, pp. 165-177, (2017); Korshunov P., Marcel S., Deepfakes: A New Threat to Face Recognition?

Thanks to the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis, processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing, storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances. We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware of IoT devices. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, problems such as poor optimization under face recognition integration and high latency of smart home gesture recognition control still exist. In this paper, in response to the problems raised above, the more mature CNN algorithm and OT prime tracking algorithm are used for face recognition, and the Euclidean distance is introduced as the adjustable threshold for face recognition, and its recognition response time is 29-30ms; in gesture recognition, the mathematical model of finger angle recognition is used for gesture recognition, based on the Mediapipe open source framework, and in the experiment, its recognition time tends to be 60-100 frames, with an average response time of 61.75ms. These advances in facial and gesture recognition in home security systems provide faster and more accurate recognition, thereby enhancing the owner 's safety measures. The results of this study provide relevant insights into the development of smart home security systems and their implementation in real-world scenarios. © 2023 SPIE.","CNN Algorithm; Face Recognition; Gesture Recognition; Mediapipe; Raspberry Pi","Automation; Gesture recognition; Response time (computer systems); Security systems; CNN algorithm; Gestures recognition; Home security systems; Intelligent security systems; Mediapipe; Optimisations; Raspberry pi; Recognition control; smart home; Tracking algorithm; Face recognition","","","","","Characteristic Innovation Program of Universities in Guangdong Province, (2021KTSCX185)","This paper is supported by Characteristic Innovation Program of Universities in Guangdong Province (2021KTSCX185).","Fangliang Zhao, Embedded Linux Porting and Driver Design in Smart Home [D], pp. 1-7, (2016); Yitong Xu, Meixia Wang, Peipei Zhang, Application of Dlib face recognition in teacher attendance [J], Computer programming skills and maintenance, 2, pp. 123-125, (2022); Liancheng Su, Design of Smart Home Control Device Based on Raspberry Pi and Cloud Platform (optional) [D]; Yanying Zhu, Zhizen Lai, Fan Li, Et al., Laboratory attendance system based on face recognition[J], IoT Technology, 13, 1, pp. 14-16, (2023); Xiaolong Dong, Research on Smart Home System Based on OneNET and Raspberry Pi 4B [J], Woodworking Machine, 1, pp. 4-6, (2021); Farokhah Lia, Perbandingan, Metode Deteksi, Wajah Menggunakan.

This paper presents a conceptual design and development of an IoT contactless door buzzer, automation and home security device using a Raspberry Pi microprocessor and mechanical system embedded with a home security camera. Therefore, the main objective of our work is to design a system which can alert the user and others of an intruder break-in by sending a notification to their smartphones. The owner will also have the ability to stop or start the alarm remotely using just his smartphone. The proposed system aims to assist blind and visually impaired people in unlocking their house's main door without using a manual key but by scanning the person's face through face recognition technology. A pi camera is connected directly to the Raspberry Pi. A relay controls the circuit to switch high current, on/off and electrically isolated signals, while the ultrasonic sensor is object detection in front of the door. A mobile application is developed for the user to control the device. An alert will be sent to the user if a thief breaks into the door without the owner's consent for them to take necessary precautionary measures.  © 2022 IEEE.","Contactless door; Home security system;

With this motto an application is developed for the purpose of home which is called a virtual assistance and it also provides security to people by incorporating continuous surveillance in home. This made the home as smart and secure. In this paper a novel method is proposed and implemented that helps the people to getting the home status through IoT communication channels. A cost-effective stand-alone device for users to notify through surveillance module whenever a person interacts with the main door of the house. The system is working with a Raspberry Pi which is connecting with a Pi camera, a channel relay, a microphone connectivity and few speakers connected around the home. When a visitor interacts with the main door, the captured image is sent to the owner personal mobile via an e-mail which helps to notify the owner that someone is at the door. The visitor's image along with the date and timestamp is sent to the server for retrieving information later. A personal assistant is embedded in this application which acts solely to the owner and executes the commands that are given by the owner. The system is tested countless times to be effective, and easy to utilize and also to enhance the safety of the user.  © 2021 IEEE.","IoT; Pi Camera and Raspberry Pi; Smart Home; surveillance; virtual Assistance","Automation; Cost effectiveness; Network security; Cost effective; IoT; Personal assistants; smart home; Stand-alone devices; Time-stamp; Virtual assistants; IoT","","","","","","","Khattar S., Sachdeva A., Kumar R., Gupta R., Smart home with virtual assistant using raspberry pi, 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence), (2019); Srinath M.S., Interactive home automation system with google assistant, International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 119, 12, pp. 14083-14086, (2018); Toschi G.M., Campos L.B., Cugnasca C.E., Home automation networks: A survey, Comput.

Privacy and security have become the most pressing issues in the IoT network, especially in the smart home. Nevertheless, there are still many smart home devices that have not implemented security and privacy policies. This study proposes a remote sensor control system built on ESP32 to implement a smart home through the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) protocol by applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key. It addresses security issues in the smart home by encrypting messages sent from users to sensors. Besides ESP32, the system implementation also uses Raspberry Pi and smartphone with android. The network was analyzed using Wireshark, and it showed that the message sent was encrypted. This implementation could prevent brute force attacks, with the result that it could guarantee the confidentiality of a message. Meanwhile, from several experiments conducted in this study, the difference in the average time of sending encrypted and unencrypted messages was not too significant, i.e., 20 ms.  © 2021 IEEE.","AES; ESP32; MQTT protocol; smart home","Cryptography; Data privacy; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Network security; Advanced Encryption Standard; Data-communication; Encryption algorithms; ESP32; Home devices; Message queuing telemetry transport protocol; Pressung; Privacy and security; smart home; Transport protocols; Automation","","","","","","","Guaman Y., Ninahualpa G., Salazar G., Guarda T., Comparative performance analysis between MQTT and CoAP Protocols for IoT with Raspberry PI 3 in IEEE 802. 11 Environments, Iber.

In the conventional home monitoring arrangement, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is used which exactly record the videos without giving any feedback to the house owner if any suspected person there. Therefore, there is a need of moving object detection system and warning system for the safety of senior citizen in the home. The proposed hardware architecture is carried out using Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3 processor. The Raspberry Pi 3 process the images received through the Passive Infra Red (PIR) sensor and webcam assembled on Raspberry Pi 3. The PIR sensor activates the webcam, if any movement is detected around the sensor. The captured image is compared with two frames, if any motion is detected immediate alert in the form of call and mail is shared to the house owner in addition to the detected the motion object image.  © 2022 IEEE.","Closed-Circuit Television; IoT; PIR Sensor; Raspbery Pi; sensor; Smart Home","Automation; Motion analysis; Object detection; Timing circuits; Alert systems; Closed circuit television; Home security systems; Home-based; Human being; Infra-red sensor; Passive infra red sensor; Raspbery pi; smart home; WebCams; IoT","","","","","","","Eseosa O., Promise E., GSM based intelligent security system for intrusion detection, Int.

Along with the development of internet technology, social media is getting cheaper than conventional telephones. Based on the emergence of social media applications that replace the current telephone function, and the importance of a home security system that can provide home security information remotely, this study aims to design a home security notification system using the Telegram social media application and single board computer devices. The system prototype was built using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method with tools and materials such as motion sensor components and sound sensors as detectors, processing components using a single board computer type Raspberry Pi and output components such as buzzer alarms and internet modems. The test method uses a box house simulation construction. Motion detection testing is done by simulating the hand movements in the box. While the sound detection test is carried out by giving a hand sound on the inside of the box house. From the two tests, the system detects motion and sound then activates an alarm, and simultaneously sends home security notifications to users via the Telegram social media application. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

There are many IoT devices brought into their houses. Number of ads and distractions with them is just growing up. IoT device created to help PwD to feel more comfortable and easier to interact with the outer world (as an example visually impaired users). What if we make them trigger some tasks just with a simple voice command? This will allow PwD to become more independent to control the whole network. With the help of Alexa Echo device, Raspberry Pi, OpenDNS, and some networking configuration we could implement a comprehensive network control solution. Previous research gave us the idea that a small device like Raspberry Pi could be a good and cheap solution for that purpose. With the Pi4 release it got even more obvious to try using this device as main DNS server for the whole network. It will run in the background of the home environment controlling the whole traffic that goes through the router. Every device connected to the network however will be having the benefits of non-distracting and quicker internet. In addition, the feature of controlling the network with the simple voice command through Alexa device will be a handy additional functionality to PwD and whole network. In the future project this whole setup could be adjusted to prevent any malicious attack with the help of AI assistance and Machine learning algorithms.  © 2022 IEEE.","Ama-zon Echo; Artificial Intelligence; Home Security; IoT; Machine Learning; OpenDNS; PwD; Raspberry Pi; TiggerCMD; Voice command","Automation; Edge computing; IoT; Learning algorithms; Network security; Ama-zon echo; Home environment; Home security; IoT; Machine-learning; OpenDNS; PwD; Raspberry pi; Tiggercmd; Voice command; Machine learning","","","","","","","Aldaej A., Enhancing cyber security in modern IoT using intrusion prevention algorithm for iot (ipai), IEEE Access, (2019); Alsoufi M.A., Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in iot using deep learning: A systematic literature review, Applied sciences, pp. 1-24, (2021); Amazon alexa skills; Bogdan Jeliskoski B.S.A.B., Securing a home network by using raspberry pi as a vpn gateway; Chanchal Singh P.R.N.P., Protecting smart home environment using machine learning algorithm based on IoT, A Journal of Physical Sciences, Engineering and Technology, pp. 89-92, (2020); Choi C., Choi J., Ontology-based security context reasoning for power iot-cloud security service, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 110510-110517, (2019); Demetriou S., Zhang N., Lee Y., Wang X., Gunter C., Zhou X., Grace M., Guardian of the han: Thwarting mobile attacks on smarthome devices using os-level situation awareness, Journal of High Energy Physics, (2017); Sobnath Drishty Nasralla M.M., Ur Rehman I., Smart cities to improve mobility and quality of life of the visually impaired, (2019); Elmer Lastdrager C.H.J.J.A.M.D., Protecting home networks from insecure iot devices, A Journal of Physical Sciences, Engineering and Technology, pp. 1-6, (2020); Glegolaa W., MobileNet family tailored for Raspberry Pi, ScienceDirect, 192, pp. 2249-2258, (2021); Ibbad Hafeez M.A.S.T., Protecting iot-environments against traffic analysis attacks with traffic morphing, IEEE, pp. 196-201, (2019); Riliskis J Hong L., Levy A., Don't talk unless i say so! securing the IoT with default off networking, 2018 IEEE/ACM Third International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation (IoTDI), pp. 117-128, (2018); Lee C., Zappaterra L., Choi K., Choi H., Securing smart home: Technologies, security challenges, and security requirements, 2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security, pp. 67-72, (2014); Garfinkel T., Casado M., Sane: A protection architecture for enterprise networks, 2006: In Proc.

In today's world, automated systems [1] are replacing manual systems progressively. In this paper, an overview of current and emerging home automation systems is discussed. Then, the developed system is presented that is a one-stop-shop for all the use cases with the novelty of transforming traditional homes into smart home through merging Artificial Intelligence (AI) [2] and IoT [3] thus providing the freedom to connect, integrate, monitor, and control houses remotely, securely, and at a cheaper cost. The use of AI allows monitoring and analyzing data through dashboards. Hence, sending realtime notifications to the user to ensure home management and security remotely. Also, the novelty in introducing IoT in this system is through incorporating different modalities and functions in one system controlled remotely for example the automation and monitoring system [4], the wireless [5] irrigation system, and the security system. All the components are controlled and monitored using a central web and mobile application. On the hardware components side, the system consists of the Raspberry Pi, the RFID Card Reader, the 8-channel relay module, and some sensors. Hence, the presented system is wholesome and scalable, so the user can start small and grow on demand, as this solution is loosely coupled, and tightly integrated. In brief, the solution is a secure, reliable, cheap, and all-inclusive smart home automated system.  © 2022 IEEE.","AI; alarm system; home automation; IoT; irrigation; security; sensors; smart home; wireless","Alarm systems; Automation; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Radio frequency identification (RFID); 'current; Automated systems; Automation technology; Home automation; Irrigation systems; Security; Simple++; smart home; Smart-home system; System prototype; Irrigation","","","","","","","Loia V., Sessa S., Soft Computing Agents: New Trends for Designing Autonomous Systems, (2002); Area Efficient Architecture for Large Scale Implementation of Biologically Plausible Spiking Neural Networks on Reconfigurable Hardware, 2006 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications, pp. 1-2, (2006); Oracle: What Is IoT?; Gadtaula P., Home Automation, 26, (2018); Choy S., Weyer E., Reconfiguration scheme to mitigate faults in automated irrigation channels, 44th Ieee Conference on Decision and Control, (2005); Huang K.-Q., Wu M.-G., Smart home based on home network, Journal of Zhejiang University (Engineering Science), Vo 1, 36, 6, pp. 616-620, (2002); 3M Track and Trace Solutions, (2008); Blake S.M., Control4, (2003); Joyce S.F., Smartthings, (2010); Hayes C., Right recipe for smart: Add a pinch of ai to the iot: Blending the IoT with evolving technologies will create new opportunities for smart projects, particularly as we emerge from the pandemic.

Further, with the development of the SBCs having a powerful processor and high RAM support-they are already deployed in many applications such as in agriculture, home security, automation, drones, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and like-wise. However, each SBC has a unique capability and therefore some SBC may perform better than others depending upon the application. Further, some SBC has high processing power but they are either costly or support fewer I/O pins. Similarly, some SBC are cost-effective, has a high number of I/O pins but they have quite less processing power for executing complex instructions and tasks. In addition, for some SBC there is no dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) available that can be used to program SBC according to the user-specific need. Due to these above-mentioned problems, the user has to either invest in the high processing power SBC (having high price) but compromise with less I/O pins or invest in the SBC (having low price) that has the high number of I/O pins but compromise with low processing power (although there are some SBCs available in the market that has high processing power along with the high number of I/O pins. But they are available at a quite high price so we are not considering these SBCs). In both cases, the user is not able to integrate intelligent high processing sensors and equip the system in which SBC is used with new features over time. To over this problem, we are introducing a smart and highly intelligent hybrid implementation of Raspberry pi model 3b+ with Arduino UNO board for controlling UGV. During testing, we have found that our developed hybrid SBC system for UGV work quite impressively. The CPU utilization and CPU temperature readings of the hybrid system are noted while performing various complex tasks on the UGV. Further during the evaluation process, it is observed that UGV consumed a maximum of 80% of system CPU utilization to perform all the allocated tasks efficiently. The rest 20% of the CPU usage as well as some of the GPIO pins of Raspberry pi are reserved and can be used to implement various complex applications in the UGV based on the user requirement.  © 2022 ACM.","Arduino; Hybrid system; Processing; Raspberry pi; Single-board computer (SBC); Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)","Cost effectiveness; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Arduino; Complex task; Cost effective; High processing power; Processing power; Raspberry pi; Single board computers; Single-board computer; Single-board computers; Unmanned ground vehicle; Hybrid systems","","","","","","","About Arduino, (2021); Nayyar A., Puri V., A review of Arduino board's, Lilypad's & Arduino shields, 2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom), pp. 1485-1492, (2016); Puri V., Nayyar A., Handbook of Arduino: Technical and Practice, (2017); Arduino: A Technical Reference by J.M.

IoTs allow humans to interact and control everyday objects wirelessly to provide more convenience in their lifestyle. The Raspberry Pi is a small, lightweight, and cheap single-board computer that can fit on a human's palm. Security plays a big role in a home. People concern about security by preventing any intruders to enter their home property. Therefore, a smart surveillance monitoring system is proposed to solve this problem by detecting intruders and capturing the images of the intruder. Notifications will also be sent to the user immediately when motions are detected. This smart surveillance monitoring system only stores the images of the intruders that triggered the motion sensor, making this system use significantly less storage space. The proposed Raspberry Pi is connected with a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, a webcam, and an internet connection, the whole device can be configured to carry out the surveillance tasks. The objectives of this project are to design, implement and test the surveillance system using the Raspberry Pi. This proposed surveillance system provides the user with a live stream of the video feed for the user. Whenever a motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, the web camera may capture an image of the intruder and alert the users (owners) through email notifications.  © 2023 Author(s).","IoT; Passive Infrared Motion Sensor; raspberry pi","","","","","","","","IoT Application Development: Home Security System 2017, IEEE International Conference on Technological Innovations in ICT Agriculture and Rural Development; IoT-Based Smart Video Surveillance System Conference Paper in Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing·, (2017); Syadus Sefat Md., Al Mamun Khan A., Shahjahan Md., Implementation of vision-based intelligent home automation and security system, 3rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on INFORMATICS, ELECTRONICS VISIon 2014.; Altahir A.A., Asirvadam V.S., Optimizing Visual Surveillance Sensor Coverage Using Dynamic Prograrnming, 2016 IEEE Sensors Journal.; Abudoulikemu Yimamuaishan., Huang Y., Changqing, A Scalable Intelligent Service Model for Video Surveillance System Based on RTCP, Signal Processing Systems (ICSPS), 2010 2nd International Conference on, 3, (2010); Bahlmann C., Zhu Y., Ramesh Y., Pellkofer M., Koehle T., A system for traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition using color, shape, and motion information, IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings, pp. 255-260, (2005); Heinrich A., Znamenskiy D., Vink J.P., Robust and Sensitive Video Motion Detection for Sleep Analysis.

Consequently, many of these devices are equipped with microphones, raising significant privacy concerns: users may not always be aware of when audio recordings are sent to the cloud, or who may gain access to the recordings. In this paper, we present the LeakyPick architecture that enables the detection of the smart home devices that stream recorded audio to the Internet in response to observing a sound. Our proof-of-concept is a LeakyPick device that is placed in a user's smart home and periodically ""probes""other devices in its environment and monitors the subsequent network traffic for statistical patterns that indicate audio transmission. Our prototype is built on a Raspberry Pi for less than USD $40 and has a measurement accuracy of 94% in detecting audio transmissions for a collection of 8 devices with voice assistant capabilities. Furthermore, we used LeakyPick to identify 89 words that an Amazon Echo Dot misinterprets as its wake-word, resulting in unexpected audio transmission. LeakyPick provides a cost effective approach to help regular consumers monitor their homes for sound-triggered devices that unexpectedly transmit audio to the cloud. © 2020 ACM.","","Ambient intelligence; Audio acoustics; Audio recordings; Audio systems; Automation; Cost effectiveness; Security of data; Security systems; Audio transmission; Cost-effective approach; IoT; Measurement accuracy; Network traffic; Privacy concerns; Proof of concept; Statistical pattern; IoT","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1119 – 236615297)","We thank our anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive feedback.

There is a high probability of any theft during our absence. When such incidents take place, it is often the case that we seek the help of the police and even sometimes we are unable to recover our belongings. One of the most effective ways to address this issue is to inform the homeowner of any burglary. The homeowners can safeguard their valuables if such information is available in time. The purpose of this work is to inform the home owner about any such untoward incident occurs. That is when their secret locker is broken or when any next person tries to look at it, then our proposed solution will intimate the homeowner with relevant information. IoT-based heist detector is to build a smart security system that could be accommodated by all level of peoples by means of cost, low power consumption, and easy implementation. This work covers both hardware (Raspberry Pi) and software parts. The hardware part includes GSM module, camera module, magnetic switch, etc. The proposed solution is connected with an android (telegram) that helps to receive the captured image and short message service on the incident. So that homeowner can take decision accordingly. The GSM module in the proposed system sends messages and calls to the various mobile numbers as provided by the admin so that there could be very less chances to miss the calls or messages. Since most of the theft could be happening at midnight, most of the people’s phone would be in silent/do not disturb mode so that the system enable us to set such timings, and it automatically rings when it receives call from the GSM. Many security systems have been developed to monitor and secure our property but some of them have very complicated connectivity and their implementation cost is high. This system starts working when the connection between the sensors mounted on the door is disconnected. The test results shows that the proposed IoT-based real-time system outperforms the existing security system in terms of cost, performance, and its unique features. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","GSM module; Heist detector; IoT; Raspberry Pi","Crime; Interactive computer systems; IoT; Mobile security; Real time systems; Security systems; GSM module; Heist detector; High probability; Home office; Home owners; IoT; Low-power consumption; Lower-power consumption; Raspberry pi; Real - Time system; Global system for mobile communications","","","","","","","Majgaonkar N., Hodekar R., Bandagale P., Automatic door locking system, Int.

It can help users in this field get an advantage in terms of enhanced touchless authentication, especially in spreading infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even though there is a number of available security systems, they suffer from one or more of issues, such as identity fraud, loss of keys and passwords, or spreading diseases through touch authentication tools. To overcome these issues, IoT-based intelligent control medical authentication systems using DL models are proposed to enhance the security factor of medical and healthcare places effectively. This work applies IoT with DL models to recognize human faces for authentication in smart control medical systems. We use Raspberry Pi (RPi) because it has low cost and acts as the main controller in this system. The installation of a smart control system using general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of RPi also enhanced the antitheft for smart locks, and the RPi is connected to smart doors. For user authentication, a camera module is used to capture the face image and compare them with database images for getting access. The proposed approach performs face detection using the Haar cascade techniques, while for face recognition, the system comprises the following steps. The first step is the facial feature extraction step, which is done using the pretrained CNN models (ResNet-50 and VGG-16) along with linear binary pattern histogram (LBPH) algorithm. The second step is the classification step which can be done using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Only classified face as genuine leads to unlock the door; otherwise, the door is locked, and the system sends a notification email to the home/medical place with detected face images and stores the detected person name and time information on the SQL database. The comparative study of this work shows that the approach achieved 99.56% accuracy compared with some different related methods.  © 2022 Tahir Hussain et al.","","Algorithms; Automated Facial Recognition;

In this work, we investigate the design of low-cost multiunit surveillance systems that can control numerous surveillance cameras to track multiple objects (i.e., people, cars, and guns) and promptly detect human activity in real time using low computational systems, such as compact or single board computers. Deep learning techniques are employed to detect certain objects to surveil homes/buildings and recognize suspicious and vital events to ensure that the system can alarm officers of relevant events, such as stranger intrusions, the presence of guns, suspicious movements, and identified fugitives. The proposed model is tested on two computational systems, specifically, a single board computer (Raspberry Pi) with the Raspbian OS and a compact computer (Intel NUC) with the Windows OS. In both systems, we employ components, such as a camera to stream real-time video and an ultrasonic sensor to alarm personnel of threats when movement is detected in restricted areas or near walls. The system program is coded in Python, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to perform recognition. The program is optimized by using a foreground object detection algorithm to improve recognition in terms of both accuracy and speed. The saliency algorithm is used to slice certain required objects from scenes, such as humans, cars, and airplanes. In this regard, two saliency algorithms, based on local and global patch saliency detection are considered. We develop a system that combines two saliency approaches and recognizes the features extracted using these saliency techniques with a conventional neural network. The field results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection, ranging between 34% and 99.9% for different situations. The low percentage is related to the presence of unclear objects or activities that are different from those involving humans. However, even in the case of low accuracy, recognition and threat identification are performed with an accuracy of 100% in approximately 0.7 s, even when using computer systems with relatively weak hardware specifications, such as a single board computer (Raspberry Pi). These results prove that the proposed system can be practically used to design a low-cost and intelligent security and tracking system. © 2021 Sabri and Li.

Real-time tracking, remote control, intruder protection, gas/fire alarm, and as well as other features are common in smart houses and buildings. In our proposed research work, the major concern is Safety and Security. Firefighting has always been a risky profession, and there have been numerous tragic casualties due to a lack of technological innovation. Furthermore, firefighting methods used today are inadequate and inefficient, as they heavily depend on humans who are susceptible to errors despite their extensive training. A fire extinguishing robot is a technology that may be used for firefighting. In the firefighting domain, the current technology focuses on extinguishing any fire with carbon dioxide if it comes across and then navigating the area to avoid any obstacles on its way. The goal of using IoT to create the robot is to use a camera to see what is going on around it and a Raspberry Pi to monitor the robot’s status. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Firefighting; IoT; Raspberry-Pi; ROBOT; Security","Cameras; Carbon dioxide; Computer vision; Fire extinguishers; Fires; IoT; Remote control; Building applications; Fire alarm; Firefighting; Gas fires; Night-vision cameras; Protection gas; Raspberry-pi; Real time tracking; Security; smart home; Robots","","","","","","","Kanwar M., Agilandeeswari L., IOT based fire fighting robot, 2018 7Th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO), (2018); Tewari A., Et al., Secure timestamp-based mutual authentication protocol for IoT devices using RFID tags, Int.

The current study proposes a deep learning-driven smart home system that integrates a Convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated decision-making such as classifying the device as “ON” and “OFF” based on its utilization at home. Additionally, to provide a decentralized, secure, and reliable mechanism to assure the authentication and identification of the IoT devices we integrated the emerging blockchain technology into this study. The proposed system is fundamentally comprised of a variety of sensors, a 5 V relay circuit, and Raspberry Pi which operates as a server and maintains the database of each device being used. Moreover, an android is developed which communicates with the Raspberry Pi interface using the Apache server and HTTP web interface. The practicality of the proposed system for home automation is tested and evaluated in the lab and in real-time to ensure its efficacy. The current study also assures that the technology and hardware utilized in the proposed smart house system are inexpensive, widely available, and scalable. Furthermore, the need for a more comprehensive security and privacy model to be incorporated into the design phase of smart home is highlighted by a discussion of the risks analysis’ implications including cyber threats, hardware security, and cyber attacks. The experimental results emphasize the significance of the proposed system and validate its usability in the real world. © Copyright 2023 Umer et al.","Cyber attacks; Cyber threats; Hardware security; Home automation; IoT; Sensors","Automation; Blockchain; Crime; Cybersecurity; Decision making; Deep learning; HTTP; IoT; Learning systems; Network security; Risk assessment; 'current; Automated decision making; Block-chain; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Home automation; Learning models; Privacy issue; Security/privacy; smart home; Authentication","","","","","","","Abdulraheem AS, Salih AA, Abdulla AI, Sadeeq M, Salim N, Abdullah H, Khalifa FM, Saeed RA., Home automation system based on IoT, Technology Reports of Kansai University, 62, 5, (2020); Abdulrahman T, Isiwekpeni O, Surajudeen-Bakinde N, Otuoze AO., Design, specification and implementation of a distributed home automation system, Procedia Computer Science, 94, 9, pp. 473-478, (2016); Akleylek S, Soysaldi M., A new lattice-based authentication scheme for IoT, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 64, 3, (2022); Al-Ali A-R, Al-Rousan M., Java-based home automation system, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 50, 2, pp. 498-504, (2004); Baudel T, Beaudouin-Lafon M., Charade: remote control of objects using free-hand gestures, Communications of the ACM, 36, 7, pp. 28-35, (1993); Breiman L., Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Breiman L, Friedman J, Olshen R, Stone C., Classification and regression trees.

To address this problem, we have come up with a solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places, it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs. Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security from hackers. © 2017 IEEE.","Background Subtraction Algorithm; Blowfish Algorithm; Decryption; Encryption; IoT; Security; Streaming; Surveillance","Acoustic streaming; Cameras; Cryptography; Digital storage; Image segmentation; Information management; Monitoring; Motion analysis; Motion compensation; Network security; Personal computing; Remote sensing; Space surveillance; Video cameras; Background subtraction algorithms; Decryption; Detecting sensors; Encryption and decryption; Security; Smart surveillance; Smart surveillance systems; Video surveillance; Security systems","","","","","","","Gu Y., Et al., Design and implementation of upnp-based surveillance camera system for home security, Information Science and Applications (ICISA), 2013 International Conference on, (2013); Bhanot R., Hans R., A review and comparative analysis of various encryption algorithms, International Journal of Security and Its Applications, 9, 4, pp. 289-306, (2015); Alabaichi A., Et al., Security Analysis of Blowfish Algorithm; Jahan Oishi N., Et al., Short Paper: Enhancing Wi-Fi Security Using A Hybrid Algorithm of Blowfish and RC6; Sumitha J., Routing algorithms in networks, Research Journal of Recent Sciences, 3, pp. 1-3, (2014)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st International Conference on Data Management, Analytics and Innovation, ICDMAI 2017","24 February 2017 through 26 February 2017","Pune","131416","","978-150904083-4","","","English","Int.

Studies show that homes without security systems are more likely to be targeted by burglars than those with professionally monitored systems. Security systems are often the first line of defense against break-ins. Today, due to the advancements in technology and in the IoT, it is possible to envision pervasive connectivity, storage and automation in systems. This paper focuses on designing and developing a model of an IoT-Based security system for homes, banks and offices in need of security. The proposed system has provision for theft and fire detection and sends alerts to the user through a text message. It also captures a number of snapshots of the intruder and mails it to the user. When compared to the other existing systems, the leverage obtained by preferring this system is that the user receives alerts irrespective of his location and whether or not he is connected to the internet or not. This system also consumes less power as the camera is activated and takes snapshots only in the presence of an intruder, unlike the CCTV system, where live feed is recorded round the clock. This system not only notifies the user but also the neighbor so that immediate action could be taken. © 2017 IEEE.","Fire alarm; IoT; PiCamera; PIR; Raspberry pi; Security for homes and enclosed spaces; SMTP-Email; Twilio","Automation; Intelligent computing; Security systems; Smart city; Design and implementations; Enclosed spaces; Fire alarm; IoT; Messaging services; Pervasive connectivity; PiCamera; Twilio; IoT","","","","","","","Burglary Statistics; Bhatkulel A.V., Shinde U.B., Zanwar S.R., Home Based Security Control System using Raspberry Pi and GSM, Internaltional Jounal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering [IJIRCC], 4, 9, pp. 16259-16264, (2016); Choudhury B., Choudhary T.S., Pranmanik A., Arif W., Mehedi J., Design and implementation of an SMS based home security system, IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies [ICECCT], pp. 1-7, (2015); Peng Z., Kato T., Takahashi H., Kinoshita T., Intelligent Home Security System Using Agent-based IoT Devices, IEEE 4th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics [GCCE], pp. 313-314, (2015); Sriskanthan N., Tan F., Karande A., Bluetooth based home automation system, Microprocessors and Microsystems, 26, 6, pp. 281-289, (2002); Huang H., Xiao S., Meng X., Xiong Y., A Remote Home Secure System Based on Wireless Sensor Network and GSM Technology, 2010 Second International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing, pp. 535-538; Kodali R.K., Jain V., Bose S., Boppana L., IoT Based Smart Security and Home Automation, International Conference on Computing/Communication and Automation [ICCCA 2016], pp. 1286-1289; Anwar S., Kishore D., IOT based Smat Home Security System with Alert and Door Access Control using Smart Phone, International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology, 5, 12, pp. 504-509, (2016); Hwang I.-K., Wireless Access Monitoring and Control System based on Digital Door Lock, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 53, 4, pp. 1724-1730, (2007); Raspberry Pi Official Website; Twiho Official Website","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 International Conference on Smart Cities, Automation and Intelligent Computing Systems, ICON-SONICS 2017","8 November 2017 through 10 November 2017","Yogyakarta","134403","","978-150906280-5","","","English","Proc.

The concept of IoT has been used in so many sectors from Smart Home to Smart City. But the main contribution of IoT in healthcare is just remarkable. This paper proposes an idea of Health Monitoring System which monitors the physiological parameters of the patient which includes Temperature, heartbeat, ECG, with the use of these sensors which can be connected to Raspberry Pi Board that transmits the data to a local server. In case of any odd behavior or any critical signs and symptoms are recognized, the caretaker in addition to medical doctors are notified by right way through the message or E-mail. To design an efficient Remote Monitoring System, Security is of paramount importance. subsequently to provide security to the patient's data Shamir's Secret key Sharing Algorithm is used in which data and keys will get split, saved at different location and to retrieve them threshold cryptography is used. For Heart Disease diagnosis the prediction algorithm support vector machine(SVM) is used. Therefore the system presents quality healthcare to all. © 2018 IEEE.","Accelerometer Sensor- ADXL335; Heartbeat and ECG sensorAD8232; IoT; Raspberry Pi; SVM; Temperature sensor LM-35","Automation; Electrocardiography; Health care; Monitoring; Physiological models; Support vector machines; Accelerometer sensor; Health monitoring system; Heart disease diagnosis; Heartbeat and ECG sensorAD8232; IoT; Physiological parameters; Remote monitoring system; Threshold cryptography; IoT","","","","","","","Pardeshi V., Sagar S., Murmuwar S., Hage P., Health monitoring system using iot and raspberry pi- A review, International Conference on Innovative Mechanism for Industry Application (ICIMIA 2017); Kaur A., Jasuja A., Health monitoring based on iot using raspberry pi, International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA 2017); Aggarwal A., Mishra A., Singhal G., Saroj S., An effcient methodology for storing sensitive data using nested cloud, International Journal of Computer Applications (0975-8887), 142, 10, (2016); Ghumbre S., Patil C., Ghatol A., Heart disease diagnosis using support vector machine, International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (ICCSIT'2011); Patil P., Waichal R., Kumbhar U., Gadkari V., Patient health monitoring system using IOT, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET); Midhundas C., Antony G., Francis S., Patient monitoring system using raspberry PI, International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR); Christopher J., Burges C., A tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2, 2, pp. 121-167, (1998); Luger G.F., Stubblefield W.A., Artificial Intelligence and the Design of Expert Systems, (1989)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE UP Section","4th IEEE International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation, ICCCA 2018","14 December 2018 through 15 December 2018","Greater Noida","150106","","978-153866947-1","","","English","Int.

While this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart home or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi configured as a network router.

There is a huge growth in technology connected to almost every field. The pace and diversity of advancement is very rapid. Hence, new technology and techniques are coming up and are put to use as per the need. In such advanced scenario, providing security to home has also become a major point of concern. Presently security cameras can be used for the same. But such cameras may be visible to intruders and there is possibility that cameras may be damaged. Hence, in order to serve the purpose, there is a need to find an alternative secure, accurate and quick method. Hence, an effort is made in this paper to design a home security system using Raspberry Pi. System requires Raspberry Pi, Camera, Touch screen and android mobile as hardware components. Python, Node.js and OpenCV libraries are used for software coding. Usually most of the intrusion detection systems click the photo of intruders as soon as the human is detected. But, such systems fail to click photos, so that the intruder can be identified (Face View Photo) and visible. In proposed system, a proper illustrative method is proposed so that the intrusion detection is accurate and photos thus captured are clear, so that intruder is clearly visible. The proposed system is designed as a smart mirror which will provide both information and home security. The system is developed to accept touch and mobile commands. As soon as the intrusion is detected, an alert message along with the identifiable and clear photo (Face view) of intruder will be sent to the owner's/administrator's mobile. The mirror owner can also see the video of deployed environment through the camera fitted on smart mirror. © 2020 The Authors.

This new technology includes embedded devices, which are connected to the internet. IoT applications are spread over various fields like agriculture, healthcare, automotive industry, home automation, and security, etc. Nowadays, Wireless Communication (WC) is becoming an essential tool to link the devices, organizations, and people in the world. In IoT, WC is budding technology and more exploration is needed. This issue motivates the authors to propose generalized framework for WC in IoT. Framework is divided into five phases according to the architecture of IoT. First two phases focus on the configuration of sensors and gateways; third phase explains the cloud integration, fourth phase is about configuration of the server, and fifth phase considers the user interface. Hence, proposed framework does ease the work of IoT application developer. Authors illustrated the framework using the case study of electricity utilization in domestic. The application uses sensors and Raspberry pi for computing and providing electricity usage consumed by home or building using wireless communication between the devices. This provides the awareness to the user about power consumption pattern and better utilization of the electricity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019","Cloud; IoT; Wireless network","Automotive industry; Clouds; Electric power utilization; User interfaces; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cloud integrations; Consumption patterns; Electricity usage; Emerging technologies; IoT; IOT applications; New technologies; Wireless communications; IoT","","","","","","","Alkhamisi A., Nazmudeen M.S.H., Buhari S.M., A cross-layer framework for sensor data aggregation for IoT applications in smart cities, 2016 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2), pp. 1-6, (2016); Chen Y., Kunz T., Performance evaluation of IoT protocols under a constrained wireless access network, International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile Wireless Networking (Mownet), pp. 1-7, (2016); Jover R.P., Murynets I., Connection-less communication of IoT devices over LTE mobile networks, 12Th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), pp. 247-255, (2015); Jaiswal A., Domanal S., Reddy G.R.M., Enhanced framework for IoT applications on python based cloud simulator (Pcs), IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM), pp. 104-108, (2015); Chauhan S., Patel P., Sureka A., Delicato F.C., Chaudhary S., Demonstration abstract: Iotsuite—a framework to design, implement, and deploy iot applications, 15Th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), Pp. 1–2.

The key challenges in a smart home are intelligent decision making, secure identification, and authentication of the IoT devices, continuous connectivity, data security, and privacy issues. The existing systems are targeting one or two of these issues whereas a smart home automation system that is not only secure but also has intelligent decision making and analytical abilities is the need of time. In this paper, we present a novel idea of a smart home that uses a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) for intelligent decision making and also uses blockchain technology to ensure identification and authentication of the IoT devices. Emerging blockchain technology plays a vital role by providing a reliable, secure, and decentralized mechanism for identification and authentication of the IoT devices used in the proposed home automation system. Moreover, the SVM classifier is applied to classify the status of devices used in the proposed smart home automation system into one of the two categories, i.e., ""ON""and ""OFF.""This system is based on Raspberry Pi, 5 V relay circuit, and some sensors. A mobile application is developed using the Android platform. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of each appliance. The HTTP web interface and apache server are used for communication among the Android app and Raspberry Pi. The proposed idea is tested in the lab and real life to validate its effectiveness and usefulness. It is also ensured that the hardware and technology used in the proposed idea are cheap, easily available, and replicable. The experimental results highlight its significance and validate the proof of the concept. © 2020 Rizwan Majeed et al.","","Ambient intelligence; android; Authentication; Blockchain; Cryptography; Decision making;

In home and working areas, people will be engaged with too many activities. Sometimes, there might be a chance to forget to turn off various electrical appliances like lights, fans, servers, if there were nobody in the room or area/passage. This leads to huge power consumption. Also, it is very difficult to physically challenged persons and old-age people to access the appliances every time manually. To avoid all such situations, we proposed “Smart Home System.” It is the process of automating home appliances in which the various electric and electronic appliances are wired up to a central computer control system so they can be handled more efficiently. “Smart Home” helps to overcome the problems that usually people face in daily life. Behind this, it needs the involvement of multiple complex hardware components in controlling the smart home project and there is a fair amount of software architecture that is responsible for driving the hardware components. Moreover, there is a need to employ persons to monitor such simple tasks. This manual approach is time-consuming and also very costly. Thus, automation is the better alternative through which these tasks can be completed automatically without human effort and also accessed remotely from anywhere and anytime with less effort. Everyone is showing interest in making their home smarter to ease their daily activities. The proposed Smart Home system has the capability to control the home appliances based on the environment. Here, different boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino UNO are going to be deployed which can take control over the appliances and act accordingly. People can also be notified, if there are any fire/gas leakages inside the home. This security system facilitates the user to take necessary actions as soon as possible to secure their home. It also involves the deployment of different kinds of sensors which can able to detect the object motion, temperature and humidity and fire detection. This application is very simple and can be implemented in all types of homes. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","IoT; MQ2; Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino UNO; Sensors","Automation; Computer control systems; Computer hardware; Domestic appliances; Energy efficiency; Man machine systems; Motion sensors; Object detection; Sensors; Complex hardware; Electrical appliances; Electronic appliances; Energy efficient systems; Hardware components; Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino UNO; Smart-home system; Temperature and humidities; IoT","","","","","","","Kovatsch M., Weiss M., Guinard D., Embedding internet technology for home automation, Proceedings IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 1-8, (2010); Elshafee A., Hamed K.A., Design and implementation of a WiFi based home automation system, Int.

Most commercial environments, during active hours, consume large amounts of energy resources; this could be optimized to the minimum by smartly monitoring and managing the resources. IoT (IoT) enables this to be a possible solution at reasonable cost factors. However, it is important to note that in commercial environments, security is a key factor; corporations cannot depend on opening up their networks to the outside world in order to avail the services offered by currently available smart-devices. Localizing and privatizing the entire automation and control system would be desirable for such domains. The work presented in this paper proposes a solution for such applications which is crucial for the development of Smart Cities as a whole along with smart home. One of the simplest tasks is to switch a light source, HVAC systems or any other electrical equipment on or off, by being physically present in the premises, remotely or automatically based on time or a sensor's reading. Furthermore, the intensity of the light source, the temperature of the HVAC systems and such parameters could also be varied. Development of technology in the field has enabled the production of cheap and small-sized computers like Raspberry Pi which are also known as Single Board Computers (SBC). The prototype designed is equipped with a secure local MQTT link for communication between the control and automation system and the Edge Devices. Additionally, it is equipped with a speech recognition system to give the users a much more intuitive and natural mean to communicate with and control the connected devices. © 2018 IEEE.","Control System; Digital Assistant; Home Automation; IoT; Smart Cities","Automation; Climate control; Energy resources; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Light sources; Smart city; Speech recognition; Automation and controls; Cost-factors; Digital assistants; Home automation; HVAC system; Key factors; Large amounts; Smart control systems; Smart devices; System solution; Control systems","","","","","","","IoT: Number of Connected Devices Worldwide 2012-2025, (2016); Hidayat S., Firmanda S.F., Scheduler and voice recognition on home automation control system"". in, 2015 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT), pp. 150-155, (2015); Baby C.J., Et al., Home automation using web application and speech recognition"". in, 2017 International Conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS), pp. 1-6, (2017); Soumya S., Et al., IoT based home automation system"". in, 2016 IEEE International Conference on Recent Trends in Electronics, Information Communication Technology (RTEICT), pp. 848-850, (2016); Tharaniya Soundhari M., Brilly Sangeetha S., Intelligent interface based speech recognition for home automation using android"". in, 2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS), pp. 1-11, (2015); Bharathi H., Et al., Home automation by using raspberry Pi and android"". in, 2017 International Conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA), 2, pp. 687-689, (2017); Jain S., Vaibhav A., Goyal L., Raspberry Pi based interactive home automation system through E-mail"". in, 2014 International Conference on Reliability Optimization and Information Technology (ICROIT), pp. 277-280, (2014); Narender M., Vijayalakshmi M., Raspberry Pi based advanced scheduled home automation system through E-mail"". in, 2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research, pp. 1-4, (2014)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Huawei; IEEE Big Data; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE SDN; Teradata","10th International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery, CyberC 2018","18 October 2018 through 20 October 2018","Zhengzhou","145527","","978-172810974-9","","","English","Proc. - Int.

One of the important aspect in the smart home system is the security capability which can simply lock and unlock the door or the gate. In this paper, we proposed a face recognition security system using Raspberry Pi which can be connected to the smart home system. Eigenface was used the feature extraction, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as the classifier. The output of face recognition algorithm is then connected to the relay circuit, in which it will lock or unlock the magnetic lock placed at the door. Results showed the effectiveness of our proposed system, in which we obtain around 90% face recognition accuracy.

Consequently, improvisations meant to complement the healthcare systems in remedying the pandemic emerged. “Hospital-at-home” improvisations include the use of wearable technology to triage patients within households before consulting the health institutions. The wearable devices collect physiological and activity data in order to detect or predict the prevalence of the disease. Unfortunately, Do-It-Yourself health improvisations expose citizens to security vulnerabilities and interoperability challenges. This study proposes the adaptation of a prototype developed prior to the pandemic in securing smart home and to interoperate health wearable devices used in detecting the prevalence of COVID-19 before symptoms manifest. Focus is placed on: 1) Integration of wearables from different vendors to ensure interoperability using the Mozilla WebThings gateway on Raspberry Pi; 2) Use of Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain to secure the data and allow for implementation of legal restrictions through software. The proposed user-centric wearables architecture enhances data privacy through edge and fog computing, whilst opening up smart home to General Data and Protection Regulations (GDPR)-inspired “data portability” and personal data monetization opportunities. © IEOM Society International.","Blockchain; COVID-19; Single Board Computers; Wearables; Web of Things","","","","","","","","Cimmino A., Poveda-villalon M., eWoT: A Semantic Interoperability Approach for Heterogeneous IoT Ecosystems Based on the Web of Things, (2020); Guinard D., Trifa V., Building the web of things: with examples in node. js and raspberry pi, (2016); Dorri A., Et al., Blockchain for IoT Security and Privacy: The Case Study of a Smart Home, (2017); Dwivedi A.

The home automation has changed the manual frame work into robotization by making the household appliances smart which plays vital role now and more in the coming future. By connecting the household appliances to the internet for remote supervision and controlling. For better results home automation is employed with energy management strategy for better fallouts. Many energy management systems are availa-ble which are having expensive cost but are not efficient. By equipping the energy meters to home appliances, the amount of energy con-sumed can be calculated by each appliance. Enhanced facilities are provided to the user in this system. The remote user can monitor the electrical appliances, can turn ON and OFF through the web page. Webcam is employed in the proposed system for better functionality and to enhance the security so that remote user can observe the living home environment. A specific threshold values are specified to electrical appliances which reduces the power consumption in an effective way. The appliances will turn OFF automatically when it reaches to the specified threshold value. The implement system uses a Raspberry Pi 3 which realizes the data received form the remote users and the webcam. The data is uploaded into the web sever through Raspberry Pi which act as central server and visualization of data will be done the user in the website. The proposed and implemented system performs the monitoring and controlling of electrical appli-ance dynamically with low cost and efficiently which reduce the power consumption. © 2018 P.

Earlier, smart locks were used which enhanced the security features of the house. The proposed model can eliminate the concept of lock system as here the security is provided to the door itself. This would result in a safe and secure door with no locks! Controlling the movement of the door is enabled by Raspberry pi and its related embedded software. Also merging IOT with android is has many advantages in terms of security. The motion sensors are used to detect any movement in front of the door. If any person comes in front of the door, a motion is triggered; the image is captured and notified to the owner. Thus in overall proposed system, two technologies are concentrated on, one is motion sensing in the front of the door in real time even if there is no one at home and the second is to control the movement of the door by the smart phone. Thus by connecting a mobile phone to a door, the owner get notified whenever any visitor visits his home and looking up to the images, the owner of the home can send the open door signal for only the trusted visitors. © 2017 IEEE.","Image capturing and notification; Motion Sensing; Safety ad Security; Smart Door System","android; Locks (fasteners); Smartphones; Soft computing; Telephone sets; android; Android platforms; Image capturing; Motion sensing; Motion sensors; Raspberry pi; Security features; Smart doors; Mobile security","","","","","","","Peng D., Peng C., A design and implement for simple smart home system for consumers, 2016 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC); Kassem A., El Murr S., Jamous G., Saad E., Geagea M., A smart lock system using Wi-Fi security, 2016 3rd International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications (ACTEA); Sarp B., Karalar T., Real time smart door system for home security, International Journal of Scientific Research in Information Systems and Engineering (IJSRISE, 1, 2, (2015)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing, ICECDS 2017","1 August 2017 through 2 August 2017","Chennai","137325","","978-153861886-8","","","English","Int.

Since CPS like smart home involves the integration of several types of sensors and equipment, therefore reliability, maintainability, security, data storage and cost-effectiveness are some of the critical issues to be addressed. In addition, interactivity and dynamic feedback, context correlation with respect to streaming events and uncertainties in event composition are also identified as major challenging issues. In the present research, a model for CPS is proposed which is a voice-controlled smart home. Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays an important role in dialog system for identifying semantic components in user utterance. The research work includes stream processing, data collection, identification of actions from voice utterance and event-based real-time decision making. The study includes deployment of various sensors and actuators for performing various actions based on voice commands. Raspberry Pi [19] is used as a central node to which various sensors and equipment are connected. It receives voice command from android device and identifies the various intents and slots from the input utterance. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Cyber physical system; Intent; Real time decision making; Slot; Smart home; Spoken language unterstanding","Automation; Cost effectiveness; Cyber Physical System; Data handling; Decision making; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Intelligent buildings; Real time systems; Semantics; Speech recognition; Intent; Real time decision-making; Slot; smart home; Spoken languages; Distributed computer systems","","","","","","","Soliman M., Abiodun T., Hamouda T., Zhou J., Lung C.-H., Smart home: Integrating IoT with web services and cloud computing, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, 2, pp. 317-320, (2013); Prasad B.R., Agarwal S., Handling big data stream analytics using Samoa framework - A practical experience, Int.

Publish/subscribe communications protocols play an important part in such low-powered device communications with MQTT protocol being most prevalent for such deployments. These protocols have enabled IoT applications such as smart home, fleet management, oil pipelines and space exploration that heavily depend on reliable communications. This paper investigates utilization of MQTT protocol for a smart home security system. A Raspberry Pi implementation detects an intrusion event using a passive infrared sensor triggering an image capture which is then communicated to the subscribed client for countermeasures.

In this ubiquitous environment, due to the heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects, conventional authentication schemes may not meet the IoT security requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated. In this paper, a two-factor inter device mutual authentication scheme for smart home is proposed, where in the first level, the key exchange is performed using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and a public key cryptography in order to validate the identity of devices; and the second level relies on the use of infrared communication to distribute the One-Time Passwords (OTPs) among devices for authentication purpose. The HLPSL language is used to model the proposed protocol, and a security analysis is conducted using the SPAN (Security Protocol Animator for AVISPA (SPAN)/AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Applications) tool, showing that the proposed scheme can achieve the goals of secrecy of secret keys and mutual authentication. A proof-of-concept in the form of a hardware design is also proposed using Raspberry-Pi, Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC), Infrared circuit and a public-key-infrastructure. Experimentally, it is shown that this hardware design can achieve secure device-to-device authentication. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","","Authentication; Automation; Chaos theory; Computer operating systems; Cryptography; Hardware; Intelligent buildings; Network security; Public key cryptography; Remote control; Device authentications; Diffie-Hellman protocol; Infrared communication; Infrared remote control; IoT; Public key infrastructure; Security requirements; Ubiquitous environments; IoT","","","","","","","Dawy Z., Saad W., Ghosh A., Andrews J.G., Yaacoub E., Towards massive machine type cellular communications, IEEE Wirel.

Nowadays, IoT-enabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in IoT. smart home have been widely accepted by individuals and organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like: delay, non-web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence, considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the delay during process of e-mail alert. This paper also confirms the advantage of Raspberry Pi flexibility and broad probability of its usage. Preliminary analyses have shown encouraging results. © 2017 IEEE.","Home security; IoT; PIR sensor; Raspberry PI","Automation; Electronic mail; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Personal computers; Security systems; Smartphones; Telecommunication services; Telephone sets; Home security; Home security systems; IoT; Network technologies; Pir sensors; Preliminary analysis; Security alerts; Smart Mobile Phones; Remote patient monitoring","","","","","","","Obaidat M.S., Nicopolitidis P., Smart Cites and Homes: Key Enabling Technologies, (2016); Asghar M.N., Principle application and vision in IoT, Global Conference on Communication Technologies (GCCT), pp. 1-6, (2015); Tanwar S., Tyagi S., Kumar S., The role of IoT and smart grid for the development of a smart city, International Conference on IoT for Technological Development, (IoT4TD), pp. 1-10, (2017); Pavithra B.R.D., IoT based monitoring and control system for home automation, IEEE International Conference on Smart City, pp. 169-173, (2015); Balasubramanian K., Cellatoglu A., Analysis of remote control techniques employed in home automation and security systems, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 55, 3, pp. 1401-1407, (2009); Dey S., Kundu T., Mukherjee S., Sarkar M., Web based real-time home automation and security system, Int.

IoTs allow human to interact and control everyday objects wirelessly to provide more convenience in their lifestyle. The Raspberry Pi is a small, lightweight and cheap single board computer that can fit on human’s palm. Security plays a big role in a home. People concern about security by preventing any intruders to enter their home. This is to prevent loss of privacy and assets. The closed-circuit television (CCTV) is one of the device used to monitor the secured area for any intruders. The use of traditional CCTV to monitor the secured area have three limitations, which are requiring a huge volume of storage to store all the videos regardless there are intruders or not, does not notify the users immediately when there are motions detected, and users must always check the CCTV recorded videos regularly to identity any intruders. Therefore, a smart surveillance monitoring system is proposed to solve this problem by detecting intruders and capturing image of the intruder. Notifications will also be sent to the user immediately when motions are detected. This smart surveillance monitoring system only store the images of the intruders that triggered the motion sensor, making this system uses significantly less storage space. The proposed Raspberry Pi is connected with a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, a webcam and internet connection, the whole device can be configured to carry out the surveillance tasks. The objectives of this project are to design, implement and test the surveillance system using the Raspberry Pi. This proposed surveillance system provides the user with live stream of video feed for the user. Whenever a motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, the web camera may capture an image of the intruder and alert the users (owners) through Short Message Service (SMS) and email notifications. The methodology used to develop this system is by using the object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) model. © 2018, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

The developing world market for smart technology is evolving to adopt and adapt to the interconnected world of devices leading to the IoT everywhere. This research paper presents the design, development, and deployment of a prototype for the secure wireless home automation system with OpenHAB 2. We employed the use of two (2) high-performance microcontrollers, namely, the Arduino Mega 2560, interfaced with a 16-channel relay, and Raspberry Pi Model B, running the OpenHAB software. The Raspberry Pi functioned as the server to develop a prototype of an automated smart home that is remotely controllable from both a web application and an Android mobile app. In designing a wireless controlled switch for home appliances, two security procedures were implemented, namely, the token-based JSON Web Token (JWT) interface and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) procedures for authentication and data encryption. Our system delivered a home automation system that leverages on the power of the latest version of OpenHAB to maximize productivity and overall home security while making it adaptable to the management of individual devices. When tested, both the developed hardware and software modules performed extremely well to meet the goal of a secured home automation system. Industry-standard penetration testing tools and frameworks, including Aircrack-ng, were utilized; wireless network audit began with a full sweep of the wireless frequencies with excellent results. It also ensures the efficient use of energy in the home as devices are intelligently controlled from both mobile and web applications. The results of the design and implementation of the additional layer for the security of the OpenHAB framework provide various theoretical and practical implications for home automation.  © 2020 Robert A.

The Smart mirror is designed using Raspberry Pi and a touch enabled screen. The designed system is capable of acting like a regular mirror in case of normal mode of operation and it acts like a smart mirror in a triggered mode of operation. The Smart mirror thus designed is an interactive system which is capable of accepting two modes of input namely touch and mobile based controls. The system is designed to display weather information, temperature and latest news on the mirror. The system is primarily designed as a home Security and Human Monitoring system. The proposed design is thought of as a package bundled with better features, which not only just displays information over screen, but also can be used for providing security. The system is built using hardware units like Raspberry Pi 3 model, touch screen, mobile device, camera and Python coding is used for software part. The system provides security against Intrusion in home. It is done using Background Subtraction along with Simple Frame Difference Approach. Once Intrusion is detected the administrator is sent alert message along with the photo of intruder. The Human Monitoring is implemented using Machine learning technique Yolo with OpenCV. During human monitoring mode of operation, if the Human under monitoring moves out of the vision range of camera, the administrator of Smart Mirror will be sent alert message. Using the mobile commands, the administrator can see the video streaming using camera fixed on the Smart Mirror. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Human Monitoring Mirror; Intrusion Detection; Raspberry Pi; Security; Smart Mirror","Cameras; Computer software; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Monitoring; Touch screens; Background subtraction; Human monitoring; Human monitoring systems; Interactive system; Machine learning techniques; Mode of operations; Security; Weather information; Mirrors","","","","","","","Kumbhar P.Y., Mulla A., Kanagi P., Sha R., Smart mirror using Raspberry PI, Int.

They are often controlled by IR remotes and cannot be controlled over the Internet. A trustworthy and cost-effective smart IR system that is able to change an IR controllable device into a smart IoT device and interconnect them for smart city/home applications is offered in this article. First, a printed circuit board (PCB) consisting of an IR receiver and multiple IR transmitters side by side which are capable of transmitting about 20 m indoors is designed and implemented. This IR transceiver board is the first of its kind. Second, the IR transceiver can be linked up with a Raspberry Pi, for which we develop two software tools, recording and replaying any IR signals so as to put the corresponding IR device in control. Third, a smartphone can be connected to the Pi by means of a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) cloud server so that the commands can be sent by the smartphone to the legacy IR device over the Internet. We have also identified the deficiency of TLS mutual authentication implemented by the popular MQTT open-source package Mosquitto for a trustworthy IoT system and patched the system. We analyze the factors that affect the IR signal transmission distance, discuss the security concerns of our IR transceiver, and illustrate the scenarios for attacks. For instance, TV can be turned off remotely by a drone equipped with the transceiver. © 2014 IEEE.","Drone; infrared (IR); IoT; smart home","Cost effectiveness; Infrared devices; Open source software; Open systems; Printed circuit boards; Smartphones; Transceivers; Trusted computing; Cloud servers; Cost effective; IoT; IR transmitters; Mutual authentication; Open source package; Printed circuit boards (PCB); Signal transmission; IoT","","","","","Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security, (BM2003201); Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars, (BK20190060); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1461060, 1547428, 1642124, 1915780, 1931871); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61532013, 61972088); Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration, (93K-9); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1003000, 2018YFB0803400, 2018YFB2100300)","Manuscript received August 13, 2019; revised December 15, 2019; accepted December 27, 2019.

The conventional home automation system allows users to control household appliances such as lights, air-conditioning, surveillance camera etc. via smartphone applications, webpages and control panels. One of the major drawbacks is with the operation efficiency, where people would still need their hands on the physical interfaces to access the system. It could be quite inconvenient for specific groups such as the elderly and disabled people, who will not benefit much from such systems. In light of this, the project proposes a methodology and design of a voice-controlled environment with emphasis on speech recognition and voice control based on Amazon Alexa and Raspberry Pi. In this implementation, office users can easily control their office appliances with voice commands, where as the model can be implemented for smart home users as well. The proposed voice-controlled implementation comprises eight main features: 1) Control of wired electrical appliances; 2) Control of Radio Frequency (RF) and Infrared (IR) appliances; 3) YouTube connected entertainment system; 4) Digital memo; 5) Face recognition attendance taking system with SQL database; 6) Security surveillance; 7) Room occupancy detection; 8) Telegram-based voice-controlled text messaging. The proposed system not only saves time but also bring convenience to people. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Alexa Skill Sets; Amazon Alexa; Home Automation System; Raspberry Pi; Telegram","Air conditioning; Automation; Character recognition; Digital radio; Domestic appliances; Face recognition; Intelligent control; IoT; Network security; Security systems; Text messaging; Amazon Alexa; Home automation systems; Raspberry pi; Skill sets; Telegram; Speech recognition","","","","","Nanyang Technological University, NTU","We wish to acknowledge the funding for this project from Nanyang Technological University under the Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus (URECA) programme.","Yew L.K., Singapore'S Smart Nation Initiative - A Policy and Organization Perspective, (2016); HDB Towns to Use Smart Technologies Under New Framework, (2014); Rehman A., Arif R., Khursheed H., Voice controlled home automation system for the elderly or disabled people, Journal of Applied Environmental and Biological Sciences, 4, pp. 55-64, (2014); Chand R., Chary M., Wireless home automation system with acoustic controlling, International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, 4, (2013); Kurkinen L., smart home and Home Automation, (2013); Stojanoski H., Bogatinoska D.C., Salem A.M., Srebrenkoska V., Practical, cheap Smart Home implementation with general purpose embedded hardware Raspberry Pi, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems, pp. 335-341, (2017); Patchava V., Kandala H.B., Babu P.R., A Smart Home Automation Technique with Raspberry Pi using IoT, International Conference on Smart Sensors and Systems, pp. 1-4, (2015); Gunputh S., Murdan A.P., Oree V., Design and implementation of a low-cost arduino-based smart home system, International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, pp. 1491-1495, (2017); Singh M.K., Sajwan S., Pal N.S., Solar assisted advance smart home automation, International Conference on Information, Communication, Instrumentation and Control, pp. 1-6, (2017); Bharathi, Srivani U., Azharudhin M.D., Srikanth M., Sukumarline M., Home automation by using raspberry Pi and android, International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology, pp. 687-689, (2017); Khera N., Tiwari S., Singh R.P., Ghosh T., Kumar P., Development of android based smart home and nurse calling system for differently abled, International Conference on Wireless Networks and Embedded System, pp. 1-4, (2016); Tanwar S., Patel P., Patel K., Tyagi S., Kumar N., Obaidat M.S., An Advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home, International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, pp. 25-29, (2017); Sai Vineeth K.V., Vamshi B., Mittal V.K., Wireless voice-controlled multi-functional secure ehome, International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, pp. 2235-2240, (2017); Cloud Speech API; Jasper Project; Alexa Voice Service; Bing Speech API; Mittal Y., Toshniwal P., Sharma S., Singhal D., Gupta R., Mittal V.K., A voice-controlled multi-functional smart home automation system, Annual IEEE India Conference, pp. 1-6, (2015); Krishna I., Lavanya K., Intelligent Home Automation System using BitVoicer, International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control, pp. 14-20, (2017); Amrutha S., Aravind S., Mathew A., Swathyugathan R., Rajasree R., Priyalakshmi S., Speech recognition based wireless automation of home loads - E home, International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology, 4, 1, (2015); Kamarudun M.R., Aiman M., Yusof F.M., Low cost smart home automation via Microsoft speech recognition, International Journal of Engineering & Computer Science, 13, 3, pp. 6-11, (2013); Eric T., Ivanovic S., Milivojsa S., Matic M., Voice control for smart home automation: Evaluation of approaches and possible architectures, International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin, pp. 140-142, (2017); Chang Y.S., Hung S.H., Wang J.C., Lin B.S., CSR: A Cloud-assisted Speech Recognition Service for Personal Mobile Device, International Conference on Parallel Processing, pp. 305-314, (2011); Bezos Says More Than 20 Million Amazon Alexa Devices Sold, (2017); January 2018 Voice App Totals Per Voice Assistant, (2018)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","2nd International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Control, ISCSIC 2018","21 September 2018 through 23 September 2018","Stockholm","142907","","978-145036628-1","","","English","ACM Int.

A large amount of data is collected from devices that could be used for different applications. The development of hardware equipment for the IoT not only use for industrial but also for smart home. The smart home covers broad topics, including remote control of home applications, sensing of humans, temperature-controlling air conditions, and security monitors. When we carry out these topics, the human-machine interface is essential for system applications. A gesture recognition system is applied to many real applications. The reason is that the accuracy rate and real factors are complicated. They commonly use of gesture control service in the market is the sensor board of gesture control. The principle is using the electric field to change and determine the gestures. The limitation requires the close operation, and there is a problem of critical point sensitivity. In this paper, we use the gesture control board to combine with gesture image recognition methods to perform the double authentication gesture recognition. Raspberry Pi is the control center to integrate the intelligent light bulb. HUE makes a gesture recognition system. The results explain that the accuracy rate of the gesture recognition proposed is 90%. Meanwhile, it is higher than the SVM method. Copyright: The Author(s).

The intelligence is embedded in them to act wise in deployed environment. Mirrors are basically used in home for the purpose of grooming up or getting ready for the day. The same mirrors can be made to behave Smart to provide Security and Vigilance in deployed environment. Smart mirror is a system that not only works as a normal mirror but also provides Security against intrusion inside the home. The proposed system is designed using Raspberry Pi, Camera, Raspberry Pi compatible touch screen and microphone as hardware components and Python for programming. The proposed system can accept 3 modes of input commands namely Voice, Touch and Mobile commands. The Smart mirror can be used as a security system against the Intrusion in home. The Yolo Technique with OpenCV for object detection is used for detection of Intrusion of Human. The Yolo (You Only Look Once) is a Machine Learning concept for the detection of objects. The Yolo is an optimized technique as it looks image only once as compared to other image processing techniques, hence work faster. The Video is converted to frames and the frames are given as input to the Raspberry Pi. The Python programming is used along-with the Yolo technique with OpenCV to detect objects. As soon as the intrusion is confirmed, the administrator of the Smart Mirror will be sent an alert E-mail along-with the photo of an intruder and the details are stored in the storage device. The voice and Touch screen commands can be used whenever an administrator/owner is in front of the mirror. The mobile based controls can be used when the administrator/owner of the mirror is away from the mirror. The basic theme of the proposed model is that, to make use of household devices for providing security. ©2019 IEEE.","Raspberry Pi; Security and Vigilance and Intrusion Detection; Smart Mirror","High level languages; Intrusion detection; Object detection; Object recognition; Touch screens; Virtual storage; Hardware components; Household devices; Image processing technique; Python programming; Mirrors","","","","","","","Kumbhar P.Y., Mulla A., Kanagi P., Shah R., Smart mirror using raspberry pi, International Journal for Research in Emerging Science and Technology, 5, 4, (2018); Jagdish A., Pateljayshri T., Sadgir Sonal D., Dokhale S.A., A review paper design and development of a smart mirror using raspberry pi, International Journal of Engineering Science Invention (IJESI) ISSN, 7, 4, pp. 40-43; Ravi Kiran S.C.V.S.L.S., Kakarla N.B., Naik B.P., Implementation of home automation system using smart mirror, International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 6, 3, (2018); Ajayan J., Santhosh Kumar P., Saravanan S., Sivadharini S., Sophia R., Development of smart mirror usingraspberry-pi 3 for interactive multimedia,  International Conference on Recent Innovations in Science and Management ICRISEM’-2018; Divyashree K.J., Vijaya P.A., Awasthi N., Design and implementation of smart mirror as a personal assistant using raspberry pi, International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 6, 3, (2018); Assudani M., Kazi A.S., Sherke P.O., Dwivedi S.V., Shaikh Z.S., Hermione 1.0”- a voice based home assistant system, National Conference on Advances in Engineering and Applied Science (NCAEAS), (2018); Sundari K.B.T., Prakash A., Suparna K., Krishna Nayak R., Using raspberry pi to design smart mirror applications, IJETST-, 5, 4, pp. 6585-6589; Chandel S., Mandwarya A., Ushasukhanya S., Implementation of magic mirror using raspberry PI 3, International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 118, 22, (2018); Yong S., Liqing G., Ke D., Design of smart mirror based on raspberry pi, JETST-, 5, 4, pp. 6585-6589; Jin K., Deng X., Huang Z., Chen S., Design of smart mirror based on raspberry pi,  IEEE Advanced Information Management, Communicates,Electronic and Automation Control Conference(IMCEC 2018); Akshaya R., Niroshma Raj N., Gowri S., Smart mirror- digital magazine for university implemented using raspberry pi, International Conference on Emerging Trends and Innovations in Engineering and Technological Research (ICETIETR) -2018; Lakshmi N.M., Chandana M.S., IoT based smart mirror using raspberry pi, International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT), 6, pp. 13-2018; Mittal D.K., Verma V., Rastogi R., A comparative study and new model for smart mirror, International Journal of Scientific Research in Research Paper, Computer Science and Engineering, 5, 6, pp. 58-61, (2017); Siripala M.B.N., Nirosha M., Jayaweera P.A.D.A., Dananjaya N.D.A.S., Fernando S.G.S., Raspbian magic mirror-a smart mirror to monitor children by using raspberry pi technology, International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, 7, 12, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics, ICOEI 2019","23 April 2019 through 25 April 2019","Tirunelveli","152706","","978-153869439-8","","","English","Proc.

Using the concept of IoT and networking, we make sure that the people not only lead a more comfortable life, but a more secure one as well. In this paper we take the concept of smart home systems and add additional security features to the concept to make living safe and secure along with comfortable and cozy. Using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, our system alerts the user when an unknown person is detected within the household so that they can take the required steps needed in case it is an unwanted intruder. In the modern, fast paced world we live in, where security threats grow in large numbers each day, the need for home security increases with the same intensity. A smarter, more efficient and a more convenient approach towards home security ensures an increase in the number of people having access to such systems as well as makes sure of a decrease in the number of people having difficulty with confusing and complex security interfaces. This project turns your mundane everyday object into defenders of your home, eliminating the need to bring in any other expensive security devices. Additionally, it also lets you keep a track of your entire household objects in one place. © BEIESP.","Arduino; IOT; Security; Smart home","","","","","","","","Namboodiri V., Aravinthan V., Mohapatra S.N., Karimi B., Toward a Secure Wireless-Based Home Area Network for Metering in Smart Grids, IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL, 8, 2, (2014); Komninos N., Philippou E., Pitsillides A., Survey in Smart Grid and Smart Home Security: Issues, Challenges and Countermeasures, IEEE COMMUNICATION SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, 16, 4, (2014); Kumar P., Gurtov A., Iinatti J., Ylianttila M., Sain M., Lightweight and Secure Session-Key Establishment Scheme in Smart Home Environments, IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, 16, 1, (2016); Jose A.C., Malekian R., Ye N., Improving Home Automation Security, (2016); Khan M., Silva B.N., Han K., IoT Based Energy Aware Smart Home Control System, (2016)","","","Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication","","","","","","22498958","","","","English","Int.

Each connectivity opens the door to new possibilities to make a person's life easier and convenient. A smart home is one such area impacted by IoT which greatly improves a person's life by helping them create a secure environment for his family and carry out his day-to-day activities with ease. Focusing primarily in the context of Nepal where available smart systems are either expensive or lack basic features, this paper essentially deals with the design and implementation of a cost-efficient smart home system focusing on remote surveillance, monitoring different aspects (movement detections, surveillance and temperature and humidity) of a home with notification alerts. Furthermore, the system also aims to reduce electricity usage and minimize energy consumption by helping a person automate their everyday tasks such as turning on/off lights, thermostats, etc. by detecting their presence. Raspberry Pi is the heart of the home system managing all of these services.

Due to the ever-increasing responsibilities and daily tasks, people spend most of the time away from their homes. In such situations, identifying a visitor and getting remote access to their home is indispensable. A smart door lock which can be completely monitored and controlled from a remote location using an android on a smartphone is proposed in this paper. When a visitor presses a calling bell/push button at the door, a Raspberry Pi with HD camera gets powered up and notifies the owner with a message and streams visitors' live identity on owner's mobile over the Internet. The owner, based on his willingness, can easily open/close the door remotely by entering a password that was preset. In addition, he can also convey an audio message to the visitor by entering the corresponding text in his smartphone app. The proof of concept provided in this paper emphasizes the real-time remote accessibility in the owner's hand (smartphone) on an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) over a cloud server. © 2019 IEEE.","Android app; Blynk; Cloud server; Home automation; IoT; Lock; Real-time control live camera feed; Remote access; Smart","Graphical user interfaces; Locks (fasteners); Mobile security; Smartphones; android; Cloud servers; Essential features; Interactive graphical user interface; Proof of concept; Remote access; Remote location; Smart doors; Signal processing","","","","","","","Atzori L., Iera A., Morabito G., The IoT: A survey, Computer Network Amsterdam, 54, 15, pp. 2787-2805, (2010); Mohanty S.P., Choppali U., Kougianos E., Everything you wanted to know about smart cities: The IoT is the backbone, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 5, 3, pp. 60-70, (2016); Kellyand S., Tolvanen J.-P., Homeautomation, Wiley IEEE Press, (2007); Hung C.-H., Bai Y.-W., Ren J.-H., Design and implementation of a single button operation for a door lock control system based on a near field communication of a smartphone, IEEE 5th InternationalConference on Consumer Electronics Berlin (ICCEBerlin), pp. 260-261, (2016); Morsalin S., Islam A.M.J., Rahat G.R., Pidim S.R.H., Rahman A., Siddiqe M.A.B., Machine-to-machine communication based smart home security system by NFC, fingerprint, and PIR sensor with mobile androidapplication, 3rd International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT), pp. 1-6, (2016); Yu Y.-C., A practical digital door lock for smart home, IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE), (2018); (2015); Heron P., Fswebcam Webcam Image Generation Program; Llc V., No-IP How to Port Forward"", Noip.com","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking, WiSPNET 2019","21 March 2019 through 23 March 2019","Chennai","158510","","978-153869279-0","","","English","Int.

This paper presents design and implementation of a ubiquitous home controlling and monitoring system that uses an inexpensive Raspberry PI as the home automation hub to connect with various household devices. Via smartphones or tablets, home owners can remotely and continuously monitor their home environment including temperature, humidity, security, and energy consumption and adjust it to a desired level, thereby gaining more security and energy saving. As an initial step, we evaluated and compared three IoT application layer protocols REST, CoAP and MQTT and our findings suggest MQTT outperforms the other two in the smart home we aim to build. Moreover, using a Raspberry PI as the home automation hub can overcome the interoperability challenges facing commercial home automation components. Our experience shows that the line of code (LOC) for adding a new device to the home automation hub is about 60 lines of Java code. We hope this work can benefit research in the smart home.

In recent days when ever house is locked the break-ins number has been increased enormously. So in order to provide security to the home this presented paper is helpful. When the intruders enters into the house, image of the intruder is captured by the system, even if intruder escapes Police need to caught the intruder to recover the stolen things which needs the picture of the intruder to the police. The planned system captures the picture of the intruder and sends it to the authorized mail through internet over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). So security to the home is provided more effectively in the smart way of communicating the things. Home appliances are smartly automated to reduce the human effort for intelligent decisions with the help of IoT. This compact and lightweight product is designed to provide security and to control home appliances in the house by the owner through IoT servers. Microcontroller used here is Raspberry Pi3 for all processing and controlling operations. Various sensors such as LM35 a temperature sensor, Light Dependent Resistor, PIR sensor with a magnetic door switch, smoke sensor are interfaced to pi General Purpose Input Output port pins through Analog to Digital Converter module along with a camera and LAN connection is interfaced to the pi board. © 2017 IEEE.","IoT; Raspberry Pi3 Microcontroller; Smart security sensors; SMTP","Analog to digital conversion; Controllers; Domestic appliances; Houses; Internet protocols; Law enforcement; Microcontrollers; Smoke abatement; Soft computing; Analog to digital converters; Controlling operations; Intelligent decisions; IoT; Light dependent resistor; Light-weight products; Security sensors; SMTP; IoT","","","","","","","Naresh D., Chakradhar B., Bluetooth based home automation and security system using ARM9, International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology (IJETT), 4, 9, (2013); Rana J., Rajendra S.N., Zigbee Based Home Automation, (2010); Nasimuzzaman Chowdhury Md., Shiblee Nooman Md., Access Control of Door and Home Security by Raspberry Pi Through Internet International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 4, 1, (2013); Ravi Chandra M.L., Chandra Sekhar Reddy P., Fault tolerance qos routing protocol for manet, IEEE 6th International Conference on Advanced Computing (IACC) Electronic, (2016); Dey S., Kundu T., Web Based Real-Time Home Automation and security system, IJEETC, 4, 3, (2015); EMBEDDED/Real Time System, (2005); Mathew N.O., Sadiku, Fundamentals of Electric CircuitsS, (2008)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing, ICECDS 2017","1 August 2017 through 2 August 2017","Chennai","137325","","978-153861886-8","","","English","Int.

The IoT is the network of interconnecting devices (may be physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc.) embedded with electronics, sensors, etc., to exchange data. Nowadays, home systems are equipped with computing and information technology which provides them with smartness and intellect. Since doors are the gateway to our homes, therefore it is necessary to make them more secure. Currently available mechanism of providing secure access to doors includes bare-metal locks and some smart locking systems. The smart locking system’s performance can be evaluated on the basis of identification accuracy, intrusiveness, and cost. In this paper, we introduce the idea to provide secure access to home. It will be achieved through smart doorbell which is a cost-effective alternative to currently its counterparts. Our system connects WiFi-enabled Android devices with firebase server using Raspberry Pi and enables user to answer the door when the doorbell is pressed. It learns to identify new user by using face recognition as a unique identity to authenticate the individual. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Door locking; Face recognition; Google firebase; IoT; Secure home","Cost effectiveness; Domestic appliances; Face recognition; Gateways (computer networks); Locks (fasteners); Android devices; Cost effective; Google firebase; Identification accuracy; Interconnecting device; Physical devices; Raspberry pi; Secure home; IoT","","","","","","","Where the Smart Is; Ho G., Leung D., Mishra P., Hosseini A., Song D., Wagner D., Smart Locks: Lessons for Securing Commodity IoT Devices, (2016); Yin D.B.M., Kamal M.I., Azmanuddin N.S., Ali S.H.S., Othman A.T., Wan-Chik R.Z., Electronic Door Access Control Using Myaccess Two-Factor Authentication Scheme Featuring Near-Field Communication and Eigenface-Based Face Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis (Malaysian Institute of Information Technology, (2016); Ferro E., Potorti F., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless protocols: A survey and a comparison, Wirel.

Web-enabled smart objects empower innovative services and applications for different domains and improve utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose an interoperable Internet-of-Things (IoTs) platform for a smart home system using a Web-of-Objects (WoO) and cloud architecture. The proposed platform controls the home appliances from anywhere and also provides the homes’ data in the cloud for various service providers’ applications and analysis. Firstly, we proposed a Raspberry PI based gateway for interoperability among various legacy home appliances, different communication technologies, and protocols. Secondly, we bring the smart home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we will provide the cloud server for smart home’ to store the homes’ data due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for various application's service providers and analysis. In the proposed smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for web-based controlling.

This system can make chosen devices smart regardless of the brand and age, and will enable remote monitoring and control of users' home. It consists of two parts, Raspberry Pi device used as a Linux server on one side and an android used as a client on the other side.

To address the requirements of securing IoT devices in edge home networks, this paper proposed a strategy capable of securing the network against most malicious activity in real-time. Firstly, we use an edge smart gateway, which is deployed on a Raspberry-Pi, runs an SDN controller and Open vSwtich (OVS) to perform traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. Then, with limited resources available on edge gateway, we use a lightweight machine-learning algorithm to classify device to device traffic and identify if there is a network intrusion. The classification model extracts features of network traffic, trained by classic supervised learning method-Decision Tree J48, then distinguish between benign and malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. Simulation results show that the model has high accuracy of intrusion and can effectively ensure security of home IoT interactions. © 2019 IEEE.","edge computing; IoT(IoT); machine-learning; network intrusion detection","Anomaly detection; Decision trees; Edge computing; Gateways (computer networks); IoT; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Personal communication systems; Classification models; Intrusion prevention; Lightweight machines; Malicious activities; Network intrusions; Network security solutions; Supervised learning methods; Traffic monitoring; Network security","","","","","","","Xiao L., Wan X., Lu X., Zhang Y., Wu D., Iot security techniques based on machine learning: How do iot devices use ai to enhance security, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 35, 5, pp. 41-49, (2018); Farris I., Taleb T., Khettab Y., Song J., A survey on emerging sdn and nfv security mechanisms for iot systems, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 21, 1, pp. 812-837, (2018); Miettinen M., Marchal S., Hafeez I., Asokan N., Sadeghi A.R., Tarkoma S., Iot sentinel: Automated device-type identification for security enforcement in iot, 2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), pp. 2177-2184, (2017); Mirsky Y., Doitshman T., Elovici Y., Shabtai A., Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection, (2018); Premsankar G., Di Francesco M., Taleb T., Edge computing for the IoT: A case study, IEEE IoT Journal, 5, 2, pp. 1275-1284, (2018); Li H., Ota K., Dong M., Learning iot in edge: Deep learning for the IoT with edge computing, IEEE Network, 32, 1, pp. 96-101, (2018); Dorri A., Kanhere S.S., Jurdak R., Gauravaram P., Blockchain for iot security and privacy: The case study of a smart home, 2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops), pp. 618-623, (2017); Wei D., Research and Implementation of IoT Security Mechanism Based on Software-defined Security [D], (2019); Blythe J.M., Johnson S.D., The Consumer Security Index for IoT: A Protocol for Developing An Index to Improve Consumer Decision Making and to Incentivize Greater Security Provision in IoT Devices, (2018); Zhang X.Y., Zeng H.S., Jia L., Research of intrusion detection system dataset-kdd cup99 [j], Computer Engineering and Design, (2010); Xiao L., Wan X., Lu X., Zhang Y., Wu D., IoT Security Techniques Based on Machine Learning, (2018); Haddadi H., Christophides V., Teixeira R., Cho K., Suzuki S., Perrig A., Siotome: An edge-isp collaborative architecture for iot security, Proc.

It's also made it simple and relatively affordable to monitor your home anytime and anywhere. the key issue in a traditional home security system is, it is easily breakable and quite outdated. This in turns, results in the robbery and also needs installation of the costly security system. To tackle this problem, we propose a smart home security system, which is IoT as well as face recognition enabled. In our system, the web camera is used which is connected to the raspberry pi accompanied by sensors such as Passive Infrared(Pir) and Ultrasonic sensor. On motion detection camera captures an image of the person in front of the door then real-time face recognition is done using local binary pattern (LBP). If person's image matches with one of the home members then the door will unlock, else doorbell will ring. if an intruder tries to break door then an alarm will be raised at the same time SMS and Email containing image of the intruder will be sent to the homeowner. Face recognition works well in multi-face recognition and stranger identification, which meet the requirement of home security. This system is battery powered in case of power failure. Furthermore, the house owner can keep track of activity happening in the house using android and web application connected to the raspberry pi using the internet.

Most of the current research study the voice command recognition for the smart home in English. Lack of study for voice command recognition in Malay makes it challenging to apply the voice command services for the smart home in Malaysia. Also, voice recognition is a non-trivial task in natural language processing. This project is to identify the command used for smart home appliances using Malay and design the algorithm for this system. Then, the proposed algorithm will be deployed on a Raspberry Pi to see the performance of Malay command in accuracy and the suitability of the algorithm to be deployed on low cost embedded devices. Light, fan, and television had been chosen as electrical appliances to build the command. An algorithm that previously used to recognize songs, the robust quad algorithm, is used in this project for voice command recognition. The proposed method has two main processes, known as feature extraction and voice recognition. In the feature extraction process, the audio fingerprint will extract data from the command spectral peak. For voice recognition, audio fingerprint matching will be used to analyze the audio commands. The outcome of this project is when the voice command is given by the user by activate or deactivate the target home appliance. The second outcome is the background noise that affects the system is reduced by using robust quad algorithm and increase the accuracy of the system. The results of this project have shown that the proposed algorithm is suitable to be implemented on a Raspberry Pi and achieve a high recognition rate with 87%. In the presence of noise with 15 dB, the proposed algorithm can maintain the high recognition rate with 82%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","audio fingerprint method; noise resistance; peak detection","","","","","","","","Kumar A., Voice Based Control Command Signal Generation for Intelligent System, IEEE UP Sect.

Such systems have obvious benefits in terms of automation, but at the same time pose significant threats to home owners if the underlying communications are not secure. To this end, we introduce a novel security protocol that simplifies the pairwise authentication and key exchange among smart home devices. The protocol leverages identity-based cryptography (IBC), thus relaxing the requirement for storing and managing public key certificates. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks associated with centralized key generation in IBC, we opt to generate the private keys in a distributed manner, involving all smart devices. We implemented our protocol on Raspberry Pi 3 devices and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of both computational and communication cost. © 2019 IEEE.","","Authentication; Automation; Intelligent buildings; Authentication and key exchange; Communication cost; Identity based cryptography; Identity-based; Its efficiencies; Public key certificates; Security protocols; Smart Home Technology; Computer networks","","","","","","","Malan D.J., Welsh M., Smith M.D., A public-key infrastructure for key distribution in tinyos based on elliptic curve cryptography, Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2004.

Machine learning is a way to achieve artificial intelligence, using difference algorithm to process difference type data, let the system analyzing, learning, processing data like the way of a human. The Artificial neural network has many types, such as the Recurrent Neural Network that good at handling continuity data, the situation like speech recognition, since speech is continuity, different letters combination with the various meaning, so continuity data is essential to speech recognition. Raspberry Pi is an excellent IoT device because it is a kind of micro-computer, you can install the operating system in it. The function is as a base; you can expand different modules. For example, if we want to collect image information, we can install the lens module, if we’re going to obtain sound data, we need to install the microphone module. The current raspberry pi already has WIFI and Bluetooth, so the raspberry pie is currently one of the favorite choices for IoT devices. In this paper, we want to apply the technique of face recognition and speech recognition in life, using a raspberry pi to build a home security system. We proposed an architecture that combines face recognition and voice recognition to develop a home security system. Through face and voice recognition, we double-checking the identity is correct or not to improve convenience and security of the smart home environment. Raspberry Pi is the home security system’s kernel and uses lens module to collect face information and microphone module to collect voice information. Raspberry Pi upload the data to the face API and speaker recognition system. The face API is used to recognize face information; the speech API is used to identify voice information. When the identity of the face API result is equal to the character of the speech API result, it is completing the verification requirement; the system will continue next step to control devices, like an electronic lock or other devices that supported remote control. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Face recognition; IoT; Raspberry Pi; Smart home; Speaker recognition","Automation; Computation theory; Computer operating systems; Data handling; Face recognition; IoT; Machine learning; Microphones; Recurrent neural networks; Remote control; Security systems; Speech; Difference algorithms; Electronic locks; Home security systems; Image information; smart home; Speaker recognition; Speaker recognition system; Voice informations; Speech recognition","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST-106-2218-E-324-002, MOST-106-2221-E-324-025)","Acknowledgements.

The design and development of an intelligent web-based door lock control system using face recognition technology, for authentication, remote monitoring of visitors and remote control of smart door lock have been reported in this paper. This system uses Haar-like features for face detection and Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) for face recognition. The system also includes a web-based remote monitoring, an authentication module, and a bare-bones embedded IoT server, which transmits the live pictures of the visitors via email along with an SMS notification, and the owner can then remotely control the lock by responding to the email with predefined security codes to unlock the door. This system finds wide applications in smart home where the physical presence of the owner at all times is not possible, and where a remote authentication and control is desired. The system has been implemented and tested using the Raspberry Pi 2 board, Python along with OpenCV are used to program the various face recognition and control modules. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Face recognition; Open CV; PHP; Python; Raspberry Pi","","","","","","","","Ahonen T., Pietikainen M., Hadid M., Maenpaa T., Face Recognition Based on the Appearance of Local Region.

The necessity of security is increasing these days, ranging from thefts, burglary, accidents, LPG gas leakage and fire detection etc, which all are important aspects of a Home Security System. In this paper, a prototype Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home (SSH) model is developed. Generally a home security system uses signals in terms of alarm of intruder detection. However, the proposed Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home uses a mobile communication (GSM) based Home Security System, which helps to provide a better security to have systems that can be globally connected. In the proposed system a text message is sent, whenever an event from any sensor is detected, so that immediate actions could be taken by the home owner. The proposed SSH sends SMS using GSM-Module and mail through Raspberry Pi micro-controller. The prototype SSH based smart system also uses an Arduino micro-controller board for commands processing and control. The system uses GSM technology, which provides global access to the Smart Home Security System. The prototype SSH, developed at a low cost, can be used for converting existing homes into smart home at relatively affordable cost and with convenience. The performance testing results of the prototype SSH are encouraging. © 2016 IEEE.","GSM; Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home; multisensor; Smart Home Security System; SMS; theft alarm","Controllers; Global system for mobile communications; Information science; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Microcontrollers; Remote control; Samarium; Security systems; Text messaging; Home security systems; Intruder detection; Mobile communications; Multi sensor; Multi-functional; Performance testing; smart home; theft alarm; Automation","","","","","","","Karri V., Lim S.D.J., Method and device to communicate via sms after a security intrusion, Proc 1st International Conference on Sensing Technology, pp. 21-23, (2005); The-History-of-Home-Security, (2010); Bernheim Brush A.J., Lee B., Mahajan R., Agarwal S., Saroiu S., Dixon C., Home automation in the wild:challenges and opportunities, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 11, (2011); Rana G.M.S.M., Khan A.A.M., Hoque M.M.N., Design and implementation of a gsm based remote home security and appliance control system, Proc. 2nd International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering, pp. 291-295, (2013); Mittal Y., Varshney A., Aggarwal P., Matani K., Kumar Mittal V., Fingerprint biometric based access control and classroom attendance management system, IEEE 12th International INDICON 2015 Conference (E3-C3), (2015); Buddubarki V., Syam P.K., Thummala B., Santosh C., Kumar Mittal V., Home automation network technologies, IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies IIIT, pp. 10-11, (2015); Mittal Y., Toshniwal P., Sharma S., Deepika S., Gupta R., Kumar Mittal V., A voice-controlled multi-functional smart home automation system, Proc.

This paper envisions a smart home based on the two independent and emerging technologies viz face recognition, for the security purposes, and speech recognition, for the automation purposes. Moreover, the latest work done is discussed briefly and why an offline system was an urgent need to fill the gap in the recent technology protocols introduced in the related field. Security system ensures the working of the smart home by taking the image on the ringing of the bell and comparing it with the stored database of owners in a robust and reliable manner through Raspberry Pi microcontroller and OpenCV. Voice control over the whole house makes this system effective and efficient which could turn out to be a great charity to handicapped, elder and paralyzed people in the remote areas with no access to internet by a single voice command in the mic connected to Arduino V3 module. © 2019 IEEE.","Arduino V3 module; LBPH; Offline face detection and recognition; OpenCV; Raspberry-pi","Automation; Face recognition; Arduino V3 module; Automation systems; Concomitant risks; Emerging technologies; Face and speech recognition; Face detection and recognition; LBPH; OpenCV; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Raut P.P., Borkar N.R., Techniques and implementation of face spoof recognition: Perspectives and prospects, IJESC, 8, 1, (2018); Kim T., Park H., Hong S.H., Chung Y., System of face recognition and sound localization for a smart door phone, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics, 59, 3, pp. 598-603, (2013); Mrutyunjaya S., Nanda C., Kumar Sahu A., Pattnaik B., Web-based online embedded door access control and home security system based on face recognition, Power and Computing Technologies [ICCPCT], 2015 International Conference on Circuit, (2015); Chowdhury N., Nooman S., Sarker S., Access control of door and home security by raspberry pi through internet, International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 4, 11, (2013); Bienvenido B.A., Paul S., Proposed image pre-processing techniques for face recognition using opencv, 3rd SPUP International Research Conference, St Paul University Philippines, (2018); Tomasz M., Chmielewska A., Weychan R., Parzych M., Dabrowski A., Influence of low resolution of images on reliability of face detection and recognition, Multimedia Tools and Applications, June, (2013); IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering (IOSR-JCE), pp. 81-83; Varsha D., Patil, A review on face recognition techniques, 8th Nation Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology (NCETET-2018), 10TH March, (2018); Selvakumar D.J., Kannan K., Arduino based voice controlled robot, International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET, 2, 1, (2015); Yan M., Jiang T., Liu Y., Et al., QGA-based feature selection of target recognition by UWB communication signal in foliage environment[C], Communication Workshop (ICCW 2015 IEEE International Conference, pp. 2524-2527, (2015); Lei X., Tu G., Alex Liu Kamran Ali X., Li C., Xie T., The Insecurity of Home Digital Voice Assistants-Amazon Alexa As a Case Study, (2017); Vernon S., Joshi S.S., Brain-muscle-computer interface: Mobile-phone prototype development and testing, IEEE Transactions, Information Technology in Biomedicine, 15, 4, pp. 531-538, (2011); Han J., Choi C.S., Park W.K., Lee I., Kim S.H., Smart home energy management system including renewable energy based on ZigBee and PLC, IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE), Las Vegas, NV, 2014, pp. 544-545, (2014); Chinchansure P.S., Kulkarni C.V., Home automation system based on FPGA and GSM, Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2014 International Conference, Coimbatore, pp. 1-5, (2014); Ullah M.A., Celik A.R., An effective approach to build smart building based on IoT (iot, Journal of Basic and Applied Scientific Research, 6, pp. 56-62, (2016); McGraw I., Prabhavalkar R., Alvarez R., Gonzalez Arenas M., Rao K., Rybach D., Alsharif O., Sak H., Gruenstein A., Beaufay F., Parada C., Personalized Speech Recognition on Mobile Devices, (2016); Milton M.A.A., Khan A.A.S., Web based remote exploration and control system using android mobile phone, Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV), 2012 International Conference, pp. 985-990, (2012); Piyare R., Tazil M., Bluetooth based home automation system using cell phone, Consumer Electronics (ISCE 2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on, (2011); Michaely A.H., Zhang X., Simko G., Parada C., Aleksic P., Keyword spotting for google assistant using contextual speech recognition, Proceedings of ASRU, (2017); Kumar M., Shimi S.L., Voice recognition based home automation system for paralyzed people, International Journal of Advanced Research in Electronics and Communication Engineering (IJARECE, 4, 10, (2015)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies, ICEET 2019","21 February 2019 through 22 February 2019","Lahore","148015","","978-153862170-7","","","English","Int.

The work deals with unusual behavior at natural access points to a home as primary and secondary access points depending on their use. Logic sensing algorithm is implemented by identifying normal user behavior at these access points and requesting user verification when necessary. User behavior identified when various access points changed states. The combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication are used to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attacks. In the experiment, the proposed logical sensing algorithm successfully implemented for a month in a studio apartment. During the course of the experiment, the algorithm understands all the state changes of the primary and secondary access points and user identity was verified 55 times by generating 14 warnings and 5 alarms. © 2018 American Scientific Publishers.","Access control; Home automation; smart home; Wireless sensor networks; ZigBee","","","","","","","","Suh C., Ko Y.-B., IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 54, (2008); Fouladi B., Ghanoun S., Security Evaluation of the Z-Wave Wireless Protocol, (2013); Wang W., Lu Z., Computer Networks, 57, (2013); Komninos N., Philippou E., Pitsillides A., IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 16, (2014); Karlof C., Wagner D., Ad Hoc Networks, 1, (2003); Hu Y., Perrig A., Johnson D., IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 24, (2006); Mo Y., Sinopoli B., Secure control against replay attacks, 2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), pp. 911-918, (2009); Deadman D., International Journal of Forecasting, 19, (2003); Jose A.C., Malekian R., Ye N., IEEE Access, 4, (2016); Jose A.C., Malekian R., Smart Computing Review, 5, (2015); Oloyede M.O., Hancke G.P., IEEE Access, 4, (2016); Ryan M., Bluetooth: With low energy comes low security, WOOT'13 Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Conference on Offensive Technologies, (2013); Namboodiri V., Aravinthan V., Mohapatra S.N., Karimi B., Jewell W., IEEE Systems Journal, 8, (2014); Al Baalbaki B., Pacheco J., Tunc C., Hariri S., Al-Nashif Y., Anomaly behavior analysis system for ZigBee in smart buildings, 2015 IEEE/ACS 12th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), pp. 1-4, (2015); Malekian R., Abdullah A.H., International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 8, (2012)","","","American Scientific Publishers","","","","","","15461955","","","","English","J.

Through the work of computer science engineers, computers can now outperform humans in many face recognition tasks, particularly those in which large databases of faces must be searched. A system with the ability to detect and recognize faces has many potential applications including crowd and airport surveillance, private security and improved human-computer interaction. An automatic face recognition system is perfectly suited to fix security issues and offer flexibility to smart house control. This project aims to replace costly image processing boards using Raspberry pi board with ARMv7 Cortex-A7 as the core within Opencv library. This project is mainly based on image processing by porting the Opencv library to the Raspberry Pi board. Algorithm for face recognition, based on principal component analysis (PCA), is programmed and implemented on the platform. The system is based on the criteria of low power consumption, resources optimization, and improved operation speed.

These communication technologies are going through sharp modernization to meet future demand growth and to achieve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid. In this paper, we implement an IPv6 based two-way communication system between the transformer agent (TA), installed at local electric transformer and various customer agents (CAs), connected to customer's smart meter. Various homes share their energy usage with the TA which in turn sends the utility's recommendations to the CAs. Raspberry Pi is used as hardware for all the CAs and the TA. We implement a self-healing mesh network between all nodes using OpenLab IEEE 802.15.4 chips and Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and the data is secured by RSA/AES keys. Several tests have been conducted in real environments, inside and outside of Carleton University, to test the performance of this communication network in various obstacle settings.

These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an android, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices. © 2019 The Authors.

An automated home is also called as a smart home. Speech based home automation uses human voice commands to operate the electrical appliances in the home. It is very useful for human beings especially for elderly and physically handicapped people. In this paper, we present the implementation details of two schemes for speech based home automation and control. The first scheme uses the Bluetooth technology for controlling of electrical appliances when we are at home. It uses a HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino Bluetooth controller mobile application for switching on or off the appliances. The second scheme uses GSM/GPRS technology for controlling the electrical appliances. The developed system also alerts the user about any intrusion into the house when we are away from the home. This system is implemented on ARM11 Raspberry Pi microcontroller board. Python integrated development environment (IDE) is used for developing the necessary software. Relays and bulbs are used as load to demonstrate the working of the prototype system.
